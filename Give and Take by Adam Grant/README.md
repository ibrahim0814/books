## Give and Take: Why Helping Others Drives Out Success by Adam Grant

### Chapter 1: Good Returns

* Givers are most likely to land at the bottom of the success ladder
* So who’s at the top - takers or matchers? It’s the givers again!
* **Most of life isn’t zero-sum, and on balance, people who choose giving as their primary reciprocity style end up reaping rewards**
* Giving is especially risky when dealing with takers
* Understanding what makes giving both powerful and dangerous is the focus of Give and Take

### Chapter 2: The Peacock and the Panda

* Since takers tend to be self-absorbed, they’re more likely to use first-person singular pronouns like I, me, mine, my, and myself
* When we have access to reputational information, we can see how people have treated others in their networks
* Lekking = Self-glorifying images, self-absorbed conversations, and sizable pay gaps
* Lekking in its many sizes and forms abounds in social network profiles
* Network ties are conduits by which information and resources are spread
* Nowadays it’s much harder for takers to get away with being fakers, fooling people into thinking they’re givers
* Takers tend to stay in touch to get favors 
* **You can understand someone’s reputation at a peer level very quickly. When your relationships and reputations are visible to the world, its harder to achieve sustainable success as a taker**
* (Quote by ‘Panda’ Adam Rifkin, founder of 106 Miles, talking about how he built his network) "With a desire to make better the lives of the people I’m connected to. Frankly, I would like to see more people helping other people."
* It’s not just about building your reputation; it really is about being there for other people
* People go to Adam because they know his heart is in the right place 
* On LinkedIn, Adam Rifkin has written recommendations for 265 different people. He gives a lot more than he receives. It’s part of his mantra to be helpful
* **It’s better to give before you receive**
* Reciprocity is a powerful norm, but it comes with two downsides: people on the receiving end often feel like they’re being manipulated + when favors come with strings attached or implied, the interaction can leave a bad taste
* Takers burn bridges, givers build bridges - Ib
* Matchers tend to build smaller networks
* **If you insist on a quid pro quo every time you help others, you will have a much narrower network**
* I believe in the strength of weak ties - Panda 
* Weak ties are more likely to open up access to a different network, facilitating the discovery of original leads
* We don’t always feel comfortable reaching out (to weak ties)
* Dormant ties offer the access to novel information that weak ties afford but without the discomfort 
* **When we need new information, we may run out of weak ties quickly, but we have a large pool of dormant ties that prove to be helpful. And the older we get, the more dormant ties we have, and the more valuable they become**
* According to networking experts, reconnecting is a totally different experience for givers, especially in a wired world
* It’s possible to track the flows of energy through networks. The givers were the suns: they injected light around the organization. Givers created opportunities for their colleagues to contribute, rather than improving their ideas and hogging credit for achievements
* Connecting is an energizing experience for givers
* See networks as a vehicle for creating value for everyone
* Rifkin doesn’t think about what any of the people he helps will contribute back to him. When Panda does ask people for help, he’s usually asking for assistance in helping someone else. By creating a norm of adding value, Rifkin transforms giving from a zero-sum loss to a win-win gain
* Giving can be contagious
* **The group is significantly better off if everyone gives**
* The presence of a single giver was enough to establish a norm of giving
* The goal of the group is to instill the value of giving 
* True giver = someone who gives on a  consistent basis - Ib
* Givers only took a productivity dive when they gave infrequently
* **Givers gain**

### Chapter 3: The Ripple Effect

* **Genius makers tend to be givers: they use their intelligence to amplify the smarts and capabilities of other people**
* Givers are more effective collaborators - Ib
* Our success depends more on others than we realize 
* **Givers reject the notion that interdependence is weak**
* Do the hard work no one else wants to do in a group - Ib 
* **Extensive research reveals that people who give their time and knowledge regularly to help their colleagues end up earning more raises and promotions in a wide range of settings**
* Always put the team ahead of yourself - Ib
* Do things that add value to other people’s life - Ib 
* When givers put a group’s interests ahead of their own, they signal that their primary goal is to benefit the group
* Highly talented people tend to make others jealous, but if these people are givers they don’t have a target on their back
* Groups reward individual sacrifice
* There’s something magical about getting the reputation as some who cares about others more than yourself
* Ask yourself: What teams are you a part of? What groups are you a part of? What can you do to make the team better? - Ib
* **Responsibility bias: exaggerating our own contributions relative to others’ inputs. When we think about who deserves the credit, we have more knowledge of our own contributions**
* Good leaders and givers: 1) Shoulder the blame for failures 2) Do not let themselves take all the credit for successes 3) Are more forgiving of other people’s mistakes 4) Care about people’s humanness - Ib
* Take care to recognize what other people's contributions
* Givers foster psychological safety: the belief that you can take a risk without being penalized or punished
* Givers specialize in the emotional support of people  
* Perspective gap: when we’re not experiencing a psychologically or physically intense state, we dramatically underestimate how much it will affect us. Without being in a state of pain themselves, physicians can’t fully realize what it’s like to be in that state 
* Givers are motivated to benefit others, so they find ways to put themselves in other people’s shoes 
* **Successful givers shift their frames of reference to the recipients perspective AKA empathy!**

### Chapter 4: Finding the Diamond in the Rough

* What happened to students when teachers believed they had high potential? Teachers’ beliefs created self-fulfilling prophecies. When teachers believed their students were bloomers, they set high expectations for their success. Teachers expectations are highly important for improving the grades and intelligence tests scores of low-achieving students and members of stigmatized minority groups
* Since matchers tend to play it safe, they often wait to offer support until they’ve seen evidence of promise. Consequently, they miss out on opportunities to develop people who don’t show a sign of talent or high potential first
* **Givers don’t wait for signs of potential. because they tend to be trusting and optimistic about other people’s intentions. In their roles as leaders, managers, and mentors, givers are inclined to see the potential in everyone. By default, givers start by viewing people as bloomers**
* **Think about every newcomer is a diamond in the rough - Ib**
* Givers resist the temptation to search for talent first. By recognizing that anyone can be a bloomer, givers focus their attention on motivation
* Givers push people to their potential. They force people to work harder than they every have in their lives which benefits those people in the long run. - Ib
* (Talking about drafting players) Teams couldn’t let go of their big bets. They stuck with the players whom they drafted early. They often invest more time when they come at a fork. This is known as escalation of commitment. 
* Do not fall victim to ego threats - Ib
* When an investment doesn’t pay off, even if the expected value is negative, we invest more. The most powerful factor is ego threat: If I don’t keep investing. I’ll look and feel like a fool
* People actually make more accurate and creative decisions when they’re choosing on behalf of others than themselves
* **Givers focus more on the interpersonal and organizational consequences of their decisions, accepting a blow to their pride and reputations in the short term in order to make better choices in the long term**
* Givers listen to negative feedback
* (On drafting players) He wanted players whose character and intelligence were as high as their vertical jumps. It’s not what a player is but what he can become
* **Givers are more receptive to expertise from others, even if it challenges their own beliefs**
* Givers are also surprisingly good at moving on when their bets don’t work out

### Chapter 5: The Power of Powerless Communication

* Takers are attracted to, and excel in, gaining dominance 
* When our audiences are skeptical, the more we try to dominate them, the more they resist. Even with a receptive audience, dominance is a zero sum game: the more power and authority I have, the less you have. 
* We’re told that great leaders use “power talk” and “power words” to forcefully convey their messages. By using powerless communication, surely people wind up at a disadvantage when it comes to influence…right? No.
* **Because givers value the perspectives and interests of others, they are more inclined toward asking questions than offering answers. They seek advice rather than imposing their views on others.**
* (Grant talking about his own class at Wharton) I open my very first class with a story about my biggest failures
* **Givers are much more comfortable expressing vulnerability: they’re interested in helping others, not gaining power over them, so they’re not afraid of exposing chinks in their armor. By making themselves vulnerable, givers can actually build prestige**
* Expressing vulnerability is only effective if the audience receives other signals establishing the speaker’s competence 
* Grant talks about how a lawyer's stutter actually helped him appeal to the jury because they thought about him as more human - Ib
* Expressing vulnerability in ways that are unrelated to competence may build prestige, but it’s only a starting point for givers to exercise influence. We need to convert the respect that we earn into a reason for our audiences to change their attitudes and behaviors 
* The more you talk, the more you think you’ve learned about the group. By talking like a taker and dominating the conversation, you believe you’ve actually come to know the people around you, even though they barely spoke
* Sales = asking questions and listening to answers - Ib
* Asking questions is a form of powerless communication that givers adopt naturally. Questions work especially well when the audience is already skeptical of your influence
* By asking questions and getting to know their customers, givers build trust and gain knowledge about their customers’ needs.  Over time, this makes them better and better at selling. 
* The art of advocacy is to lead you to my conclusion on your own terms. I want you to form your own conclusions: you’ll hold onto them more strongly - Lawyer 
* By asking people questions about their plans and intentions, we increase the likelihood that they actually act on these plans and intentions. Only works if you already feel good about the intention that the question targets. 
* **When people have to work closely together such as in teams and service relationships, powerless speech is actually more influential than powerful speech**
* Givers value the opinion of everyone, but know when to call out bullshit - Ib
* Givers thrive because people like working with and trust them
* When givers use powerless speech, they show us that they have our best interests at heart. But there’s one role in which people tend to avoid talking tentatively: leadership. Although group members perceive takers as highly effective leaders, takers actually undermine group performance 
* Talking tentatively didn’t establish dominance but it earned plenty of prestige
* (Taking about Annie, a consultant and giver) When her colleagues make a mistake, she’s regularly the one to take responsibility shielding them from the blame at the expense of her own performance 
* New research shows that advice seeking is a surprisingly effecting strategy for exercising influence when we lack authority
* Advice seeking tends to be significantly more persuasive than the taker’s preferred tactics of pressing subordinates and ingratiating superiors 
* **Advice seeking is a form of powerless communication that combines expressing vulnerably asking questions, and talking tentatively**
* When givers ask for advice, it’s because they’re genuinely interested in learning from others
* Advice seeking has four benefits: learning, perspective taking, commitment, and flattery
* **When we give our time, energy, knowledge, or resources to help others, we strive to maintain a belief that they’re worthy and deserving of our help. Seeking advice is a subtle way to invite someone to make a commitment to us**
* When we ask people for advice, we grant them prestige
* Regardless of their reciprocity styles, people love to be asked for advice
* Givers make it clear that they’re expressing vulnerability not only to earn prestige but also to make a genuine connection with the audience 
* Not every giver uses powerless communication but those who do often find that it’s useful in situations where they need to build rapport and trust

### Chapter 6: The Art of Motivation Maintenance 

* The next three chapters examine why some givers burn out while others are on fire
* Givers, it turns out, are just as ambitious as takers and matchers 
* Pathological altruism: an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one’s own needs
* Self-interest and other-interest are completely independent motivations: you can have both of them at the same time
* **Otherish givers: high concern for self-interest, high concern for others’ interests - Ib**
* By spending just five minutes reading about how the job helped other people, the givers were motivated to achieve the same level of productivity as the takers 
* Attaching a single patient’s photo to a CT exam increased diagnostic accuracy by 46%
* **Change of context is important - Ib**
* When people give continually without concern for their own well-being, they’re at risk for poor mental health and physical health
* Chunker: packing acts of kindness into a small window of time, usually during one day of the week
* The chunkers achieved gains in happiness. Chucking giving is an otherish strategy. Selfless people are more inclined to sprinkle their giving throughout their days, helping whenever people need them. This can become highly distracting. Think about hosting office hours. 
* Those who volunteered between 100 and 800 hours per year were happier and more satisfied with their lives than those who volunteered fewer than 100 or more than 800 hours annually. 100 hours/year == < 2 hours/week
* Giving has an energizing effect only if it’s an enjoyable, meaningful choice rather than undertaken out of duty and obligation
* Selfless givers are determined to be in the helper role, they’re reluctant to burden or inconvenience others. Selfless givers receive far less support than otherish givers. 
* When they’re on the brink of burnout, otherish givers seek help
* **One of the most striking aspects of the human stress response is the tendency to affiliate — that is to come together in groups to prove and receive joint protection in threatening times**
* **Otherish givers build up a support network that they can access for help when they need it. This, along with chunking giving, makes givers less vulnerable to burnout**
* Otherish givers reported that they enjoyed helping other people but were not afraid to seek out help when they needed it
* By consistently overriding their selfish impulses in order to help others, givers had strengthened their psychological muscles to the point where using willpower for painful tasks was no longer exhausting
* **Givers accrue an advantage in controlling their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors**
* (Talking about Huntsman, only 1/19 people in the world to donate more than $1 billion) Huntsman believes that being a giver actually made him rich 
* The more one gives, the better one feels; and the better one feels about it the easier it becomes to give 
* Volunteering is a long term play. You’ll only feel better if you do it consistently for a period of one year - Ib
* Older adults who volunteer or give support to others actually live longer. Giving adds meaning to our lives. 
* **Overall, on average, happier people earn more money. Happiness alone accounts for about 10% of the variation between employees in job performance**
* By giving in ways that are energizing rather than exhausting, otherish givers are more likely to rise to the top 
* Otherish givers = long term, sustainable contributors - Ib

### Chapter 7: Chump Change

* Trust is another reason that givers are so susceptible to the doormat effect: they tend to see the best in everyone, so they operate on the mistaken assumption that everyone is trustworthy
* We tend to stereotype agreeable people as givers and disagreeable people as takers
* There are lots of fakers, beware - Ib
* **Givers also gain a sincerity screening advantage from habitually trusting others, which creates opportunities to see the wide range of behaviors of which other people are capable**
* (Talking about Deloitte consultant Jason Geller) Geller starts by offering help to every new hire but in his initial conversations with them, he pays attention to who seems to be a giver verses a taker. Some folks approach the conversation in terms of learning. Others come in and say, I want to get promoted to senior consultant. What should I do? 
* Empathy is a pervasive force behind giving behaviors, but it’s also a major source of vulnerability 
* Empathy traps are common in negotiation, don’t operate like a selfless giver in these situations - Ib
* **Empathy = What other people are thinking, getting inside people’s heads rather than their heart - Ib**
* Focusing on our counterparts emotions and feelings puts us at risk of giving away too much 
* Once a counterpart is clearly acting like a taker, it makes sense for givers to flex their reciprocity styles and shift to a matching strategy 
* Generous tit-for-tat (game theory) = never forget a good turn, but occasionally forget a bad one. Cooperate until counterpart starts competing. Then you compete 2/3 of the time, and cooperate 1/3 of the time. Generous tit for tat is an otherish strategy
* Vary time investment in another person based on their reciprocity style - Ib
* Negotiating effectively is about putting yourself in a different frame of mind, such as representing your family’s interests - Ib
* When givers are advocating for someone else, pushing is closely aligned with their values of protecting and promoting the interests of others
* **Successful negotiators tend to operate in an otherish fashion. By looking for opportunities to benefit others and themselves, otherish givers are able to think in more complex ways**
* If you give to another person, make sure you tell them to give to other people in the same way - Ib

### Chapter 8: The Scrooge Shift

* **In group settings, there’s a different way for givers to make sure that they’re not being exploited: get everyone in the group to act like givers**
* (Talking about Freecycle, a site where people give away stuff for free) People who initially give things away for selfish reasons begin to care about the people they’re helping
* Common ground is a major influence on giving behaviors. This is called activating a common identity (think frats and sororities!)
* If we help people who belong to our group, we’re also helping ourselves, as we’re making the group better off
* People are willing to give freely to anyone who shares their unique identity - Ib
* We help each other without keeping score. Neither one of us ever gives it any thought; we just do what’s helpful - Panda
* We’re always looking for commonalities among us and we’re always looking to bond with other people - Ib
* **When similarities between people are rare, that becomes a part of their uncommon identity which is very powerful when it comes to exercising influence - Ib**
* Optimal distinctiveness: We look for ways to fit in and stand out
* **Being a part of a group that is clearly distinct from other groups gives us a sense of uniqueness. These are the groups in which we take the most pride and feel the most cohesive and valued** 
* People only identify with a generalized giving group after they receive enough benefits to feel like the group is helping them
* Elevation = warn feeling of being moved by others’ acts of giving, which can seem to push a mental reset button
* Givers model a standard that seems attainable
* **When people join a group, they look for cues about appropriate behaviors**
* Knowing that other people follow a set of rules means we naturally wanna do the same thing - Ib
* People are most influenced by similar others
* Just showing people how they were doing relative to the local norm caused a dramatic improvement in energy conservation. People usually don’t realize they’re deviating from the norm and showing them is often enough to motivate them to give
* It’s a part of natural selection to look out for other people in the group and to prioritize the groups interests over individual interests - Ib
* **Reciprocity Ring = Each person makes a request to the group, and the rest of the group tries to use their knowledge, resources, and connections to fulfill the request**
* Because giving appears to be uncommon in lots of groups, people with giver values begin to feel that they’re in the minority. When people assume that others aren’t givers, they act and speak in ways that discourage others from giving, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy 
* **Set up ways for people to be recognized for their work - Ib**
* Influence is far more powerful when we try to change people’s behaviors first, and their attitudes often follow. To turn takers into givers, it's often necessary to convince them to start giving
* **As people make voluntary decisions to help colleagues and customers beyond the scope of their jobs, they come to see themselves as organizational citizens**

### Chapter 9: Out of the Shadows

* The smarter negotiator appears to be able to understand his or her opponents true interests and thus to provide them with better deals at little cost to him or herself - Vandy Profs Barry and Friedman 
* The best of the best are givers, try to model your behavior after them - Ib
* **Givers see success in terms of making significant lasting contributions to a broad range of people**
* What I find most magnetic about successful givers: they get to the top without cutting others down, finding ways of expanding the pie that benefit themselves and the people around them
