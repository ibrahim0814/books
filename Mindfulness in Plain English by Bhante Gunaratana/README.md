## Mindfulness in Plain English by Bhante Gunaratana

### Chapter 1: Why Bother?

- **Meditation is not easy.** Meditation takes gumption
- Why do it? Simple. Because you are human. Just because of the simple fact that you are human, you find yourself heir to an inherent unsatisfactoriness in life that simply will not go away. You suddenly realize you are spending your whole life just barely getting by
- Watch the news on TV. Listen to the lyrics of popular songs. You find the same theme repeated over and over in variations: jealousy, suffering, discontent, and stress
- We get stuck in the “if-only” syndrome. It comes from the conditions of our own minds. It is a deep, subtle, and pervasive set of mental habits
- **Moment by moment life flows by and it is never the same. Perpetual fluctuation is the essence of the perceptual universe**
- We stick each perception into one of three mental pigeon holes: it is good, bad or neutral. The direct result of this lunacy is a perpetual treadmill race to nowhere, endlessly pounding after pleasure, endlessly fleeing from pain, and endlessly ignoring 90 percent of our experience. Then we wonder why life tastes so flat. In the final analysis this system does not work
- “Suffering” is a big word in Buddhist thought. It means that deep, subtle sense of dissatisfaction that is a part of every mind moment
- And in the end, you are going to die; in the end, you lose everything. It is all transitory
- Do not try to block things out and ignore them
- Happiness and peace are really the prime issues in human existence. That is what all of us are seeking
- What we are really after is the feeling of relief that comes when the drive is satisfied. Relief, relaxation, and an end to the tension
- **You can learn to control your mind, to step outside of the endless cycle of desire and aversion. To recognize desires but not be controlled by them**
- We have overdeveloped the material aspects of existence at the expense of the deeper emotional and spiritual aspects
- You can’t make radical changes in the pattern of your life until you begin to see yourself exactly as you are now
- The consequences of a purified mind will follow you like you own shadow. No one can do more for you than your own purified mind — no parent, no relative, no friend, no one. A well-disciplined mind brings happiness
- Civilization changes a person on the outside. Meditation softens a person from within, through and through
- You feel love toward others because you understand them, and you understand others because you have understood yourself
- **Meditation changes your character by a process of sensitization, by making you deeply aware of your own thoughts , words, and deeds.** Your arrogance evaporates, and your antagonism dries up

### Chapter 2: What Meditation Isn’t

- **This book is specific. We are dealing with the Vipassana system of meditation**
- All meditation procedures stress concentration of the mind
- Vipassana seeks another goal: awareness. The goal is insight
- **Vipassana, by definition, is the cultivation of mindfulness or awareness**
- Meditation deals with levels of consciousness that lie deeper than conceptual thought
- It is an investigation and an experiment, an adventure every time
- Meditate and you will probably dredge up various nasty matters from your past. The suppressed material that has been buried for quite some time can be scary. But exploring it is also highly profitable
- Properly done, meditation is a very gentle and gradual process
- There are three integral factors in Buddhist meditation - morality, concentration, and wisdom
- If you fail to see the consequences of your actions, you will blunder
- There is a third level of morality - ethics. This level of morality absolutely demands meditation
- Sorry, meditation is not a quick cure all, but really profound effects are down the line. Patience is key, patience

### Chapter 3: What Meditation Is

- Probably every culture on earth has produced some sort of mental practice that could be termed meditation
- Your goals: I want to understand the true nature of life. I want to know what this experience of being alive really is. I want to apprehend the true and deepest qualities of life and I don’t want to just accept somebody else’s explanation
- **In vipassana meditation we train ourselves to ignore the constant impulses to be more comfortable**
- Real peace only comes when you stop chasing it
- **When you seek to know reality without illusion, complete with all its pain and danger, real freedom and security will be yours**
- The process of change is constant and eternal
- So you pine for your lost youth, cry when your possessions are gone. Where does this pain come from? It comes from your own inattention. You failed to look closely at life. You failed to observe the constantly shifting flow of the world
- We ignore our inherent connectedness to all other beings and decide that “I” have to get more for “me”; then we marvel at how greedy and insensitive human beings are
- The more hours you spend in medication, the greater your ability to calmly observe every impulse and intention, thought and emotion, just as it arises in the mind
- Vipassana meditation is inherently experiential, not theoretical

### Chapter 4: Attitude

- Tips
  - **Don’t expect anything**
  - Don’t strain
  - Let go. Loosen up and relax
  - **Accept everything that arises**
  - Be gentle with yourself
  - Question everything
  - View all problems as challenges
  - Don’t ponder. You don’t need to figure everything out
- Stop comparing your life to other people and instead judge your own progress - Ib
- **Ordinary human thinking is full of greed, jealousy, and pride**
- Get rid of prideful thoughts - Ib
- We should rather examine the very process of perception itself. We should watch the feelings that arise and the mental activities that follow. With practice, this habit pattern replaces our normal habit of egoistic comparison and feels far more natural in the long run

### Chapter 5: The Practice

- **Start with focusing your undivided attention on your breathing to gain some degree of basic concentration**
- You are practicing mindfulness
- Seeing with wisdom means seeing things within the framework of our body-mind complex without prejudices or biases that spring from greed, hatred, and delusion
- Feeling is one of the seven universal mental factors. The other six are contact, perception, attention, concentration, life-force, and volition
- We begin seeing the mind and body as separate; we should also see their interconnectedness
- The body alone can do nothing for itself; it is like a log. The mind can do nothing without the support of the body. When we mindfully watch both body and mind, we can see how many wonderful things they do together
- **If we mindfully investigate out own mind, we will discover bitter truths about ourselves: for example, we do not really love ourselves**
- What are the things we do not like? We do not like someone who points out our faults. We do not like someone to be wiser than we are, for we are deluded about ourselves
- If we think that we don’t have the faults, we will never clear our spiritual path. **If we are blind to our own flaws, we need someone to point them out to us. When they point out our faults, we should be grateful to them**
- You have to be free from hatred when pointing out faults in others - Ib
- Our goal
  - Purification of mind
  - Overcoming sorrow and lamentation
  - Overcoming pain and grief
  - Treading the right path leading to attainment of eternal peace
  - Attaining happiness by following that path
- Practice
  - You must make every effort not to change your original position
  - After sitting motionlessly, close your eyes
  - **Keep your mind in the present moment by focusing on your breath**
  - As soon as you notice that your mind is not on your object, bring it back mindfully
- Our mind is analogous to a cup of muddy water. The longer you keep a cup of muddy water still, the more the mud settles down and the water will be seen clearly
- **Even a small degree of desire for permanence in an impermanent situation causes pain or unhappiness**

### Chapter 6: What to Do with Your Body

- The practice of meditation has been very, very thoroughly refined
- **The most essential thing is to sit with your back straight.** The spine should be like a firm young tree growing out of soft ground. The rest of your body just hangs from it in a loose, relaxed manner
- **Sit for the entire session without moving at all**
- The clothes you wear for your meditation should be loose and soft
- Your hands are cupped, one on the other and they rest on your lap with the palms turned upside down
- Choose a position that allows you to sit the longest without pain, without moving
- When using a chair: pick one that has a level seat, a straight back, and no arms

### Chapter 7: What to Do with Your Mind

- One must begin by focusing the attention on the breathing and then go on to note all other physical and mental phenomena
- The difference between being aware of the thought and thinking the thought is very real. But it is extremely subtle and difficult to see. Concentration is one of the tools needed to be able to see this difference
- Without a fixed reference point you get lost. We use breath as our focus point
- **When we truly observe the breath, we are automatically placed in the present**
- What you are looking for is the physical, tactile sensation of the air that passes in and out of the nostrils. This is usually just inside the tip of the nose
- Make no attempts to control the breath
- Just let the breath move naturally, as if you were asleep
- The monkey-mind phenomenon is well known. It is something that every seasoned mediator has had to deal with
- **Sinking denotes any dimming of awareness. Sinking mind is a void. Avoid it.**
- Vipassana meditation is an active function
- Don’t think about your problems during your practice. Push them aside very gently
- Don’t set goals for yourself that are too high to reach
- Observe each breath with care and precision. (If possible, solely focus on inhalation - Ib)

### Chapter 8: Structuring Your Meditation

- Just how do we go about this thing called mediation?
- **You need to establish a formal practice schedule**
- **Meditation recharges your mindfulness**
- Where? Find yourself a quite place, a secluded place, a place where you will be alone
- When? First thing in the morning is a great time to meditate. You may want to shower or exercise a bit
- Make your effort consistent and steady
- You’ll bolt every time something unpleasant comes up or whenever you feel restless. That’s no good. These experiences are some of the most profitable a mediator can face
- Self-discipline is different. It’s the skill of looking through the hollow shouting of your own impulses…they have no power over you. 
- **Your urges scream and bluster at you; they cajole; they coax; they threaten; they they carry no stick at all**
- **There is another word for self-discipline. It is patience**

### Chapter 9: Set-up Exercises

- Repeat this before every meditation: “I am about to tread the very same path that has been walked by the Buddha and by his great and holy disciples. An indolent person cannot follow that path. My my energy prevail. May I succeed."
- **Noble behavior means behaving in a most friendly manner. Behavior includes your thought, speech, and actions. If this triple mode of expression of your behavior is contradictory, then something is wrong, and contradictory behavior cannot be noble behavior**
- If your thoughts, words, or deeds cause harm to you or others, or both, then you must ask yourself whether you are really mindful of loving friendliness

### Chapter 10: Dealing with Problems

- **Difficulties are an integral part of your practice. They aren’t something to be avoided, they are to be used.**
- The reason we are all stuck in life’s mud is that we ceaselessly run from our problems and after our desires
- All seasoned meditators have had their own brick walls. They come up again and again
- **It is essential to learn to confront the less pleasant aspects of existence**
- Paradoxically, kindness entails confronting unpleasantness when it arises
- If you are miserable you are miserable; that is the reality. Observe if mindfully, study the phenomenon and lean its mechanics
- Pain is inevitable, suffering is not
- Buddhism does advise you to invest time and energy in learning to deal with unpleasantness
- Handling pain is a two-stage process. First, get rid of the pain if possible. Then, if some pain lingers, use it as an object of mediation
- On fear: **Observe the fear exactly like it is. Don’t cling to it. Just watch is rising and growing. Study its effect. See how it makes you feel and how it affects your body**
- We humans are great at repressing things
- Sitting through restlessness is a little breakthrough in your meditation career. It will teach you a lot
- Beginners in meditation are often much too serious for their own good. It is important to learn to looses up in your session
- A sense of failure is only another ephemeral emotional reaction. If you get involved, it feeds on your energy and it grows. If you simply stand aside and watch it, it passes away
- **There is no such things as failure in meditation. There are setbacks and difficulties**

### Chapter 11: Dealing with Distractions I

- Buddist psychology has developed a distinct system of classification. Rather than dividing thoughts into classes like ‘good’ and ‘bad’, Buddhist thinkers prefer to regard them as ’skillful’ verses ‘unskillful’. An unskillful thought is one connected with greed, hatred, or delusion. Skillful thoughts on the other hand, are those connected with generosity, compassion, and wisdom
- **Take a good strong look at the emotional response you are trying to get rid of. Actually ponder it. See how it makes you feel.** Look at what it is doing to your life, your happiness, your health and your relationships

### Chapter 12: Dealing with Distractions II

- When your mind wanders from the subject of meditation, just observe the distraction mindfully
- **Ask yourself these three questions whenever a thought comes up in your head: “What is it? How strong is it? And how long does it last?"**
- The distraction itself can be anything. Don’t try to force it out of your mind. There is no need for that. Just observe it mindfully with bare attention. And do not condemn yourself for having been strayed. Distractions are natural. They come and they go
- **Mindfulness is the most important aspect of meditation. It is the primary thing that you are trying to cultivate**
- From the point of view of mindfulness, there is really no such thing as a distraction. Whatever arises in the mind is viewed as just one more opportunity to cultivate mindfulness
- On desire: Notice the mental state of desire that accompanies it as a separate thing. Notice the exact extent or degree of that desire
- As your consciousness deepens, you gain the ability to see thoughts and sensations arising slowly, like separate bubbles, each distinct and with spaces between them
- **Conceptualization is an insidiously clever process. It creeps into your experience and it simply takes over (hint: don’t let it - Ib)**

### Chapter 13: Mindfulness (Sati)

- When you first become aware of something, there is a fleeting instance of pure awareness just before you conceptualize the thing, before you identify it
- **Mindfulness is non-judgmental. The meditator observes experiences very much like a scientist observing an object under a microscope without any preconceived notions**
- In order to observe our own fear, we must accept the fact that we are afraid
- Mindfulness is present moment awareness. It is the observance of what is happening right now in the present
- Mindfulness is non egotistic alertness. With mindfulness, one sees all phenomena without references to concepts like ‘me’, ‘my’, or ‘mine’. One does not enhance anything, One does not emphasize anything. One just observes exactly what is there — without distortion
- Mindfulness is awareness of change. It is watching things as they are changing
- Mindfulness reminds you of what you are supposed to be doing
- Mindfulness sees things as they really are
- Mindfulness actually sees. It sees the transitory nature of everything that is perceived. It also sees the inherently unsatisfactory nature of all conditioned things
- One who attends constantly to what is really going on in the mind achieves the state of ultimate sanity (housekeeping, but for your mind - Ib)
- **Mindfulness makes possible the growth of wisdom and compassion. Without mindfulness, they cannot develop to full maturity**
- Fully developed mindfulness is a state of total non-attachment and utter absence of clinging to anything in the world
- **Mindfulness neutralizes defilements in the mind. The result is a mind that reminds unstained and invulnerable, completely undisturbed by the ups and downs of life**

### Chapter 14: Mindfulness verses Concentration

- **You need a balance of concentration and mindfulness - Ib**
- You can use concentration to dominate others. You can use it to be selfish. The real problem is that concentration alone will not give you perspective on yourself
- Mindfulness does not categorize thoughts - Ib
- **There is no ‘me’ in a state of pure mindfulness**
- **Mindfulness makes you see how you hurt others - Ib**
- **Mindfulness can make you free**
- The process cannot be forced or rushed. It proceeds at its own pace
- A couple of months down the track and you will have developed concentration power. Then you can state pumping your energy into mindfulness
- You are not in competition with anybody, and there is no schedule

### Chapter 15: Meditation in Everyday Life

- Focus on fundamentals - Ib
- **Seated meditation is the arena in which mediators practice their own fundamental skills.** Even the most seasoned meditator continues to practice seated meditation
- You do not have to sit to meditate. **Meditation is awareness and it must be applied to each and every activity of one’s life**
- **Standard Buddhist practice advocates frequent retreats to complement your daily sitting practice.** A retreat is a relatively long period of time devoted exlucsively to meditation. One - or two - day retreats are common for lay people
- The usual pattern is to interferes blocks of sitting with blocks of walking mediation. An hour of each with short breaks between is common
- To do the walking meditation, you need a private place with enough space for at least five to ten paces in a straight line
- Your body goes through all kinds of contortions over the course of a single day
- As you go through your day, spend a few seconds every few minutes to check your posture. Don’t do it in a judgemental way
- Intentionally slowing down your thoughts, words, and movements allows you to penetrate far more deeply into them than you otherwise could. What you find there is utterly astonishing
- Bare attention brings order into the clutter that collects in those untidy little hidden corners of the mind
- **You start to see the extent to which you are responsible for your own mental suffering**
- **Mindfulness is a state of mental readiness. Whatever comes up can be dealt with instantly. A problem arises. You simply deal with it**
- Every spare moment can be used for meditation
- **Meditating your way through the ups and downs of daily life is the whole point of vipassana**

### Chapter 16: What’s in It for You

- **The ego sense itself is essentially a perception of distance between that which we call ‘me' and that which we call ‘other'**
- Once you have clearly seen what greed really is and what is really does to you and to others, you just naturally cease to engage in it
- Your experience of being alive, the very sensation of being conscious becomes lucid and precise. Nothing is glossed over or taken for granted, no experiences labeled as merely ‘ordinary'
- **On true mindfulness: This awareness cannot be described adequately. Words are not enough. It can only be experienced. You watch yourself twisting reality with mental comments, with stale images and personal opinions**
- On desire: As soon as you grasp anything, pain inevitably follows
- There is no static self to be found; it is all a process

### Afterword: The Power of Loving Friendliness

- **Cultivating a deep sense of loving friendliness is especially crucial for our well-being**
- **Only in a calm mind, a mind free from anger, greed, and jealousy, can the seeds of loving friendliness develop**
- With every breath, with every pulse, with every heartbeat, I [the author] try to allow my entire being to become permeated with the glow of loving friendliness
- Author talks about how he was meditating at an airport and a little child just came up to him and wrapped her arms around him and wouldn’t let go. He attributes this strange occurrence to the power of loving friendliness
- Many people have no idea how much loving friendliness they have
- We sometimes need to ignore a person’s superficial weaknesses to find her good heart
- **Cultivate loving friendliness toward yourself first**
- In time, your heart grows stronger, and the response of loving friendliness becomes automatic
- Practicing loving friendliness can change our habitual negative thought patterns and reinforce positive ones
- But loving friendliness is not limited to our thoughts. We must manifest it in our words and our actions
- **Whenever you see another being, any being, keep this in mind. Wish for them happiness, peace and well-being. It is a practice that can change your life and those around you**
- Some people think of morality as restrictions on freedom, but in fact, these precepts liberate us. They free us from the suffering we cause ourselves and others when we act unkindly
- When we are angry with someone, we often latch onto one particular aspect of that person. Usually it’s only a moment or two, enough for a few harsh words. We focus on only one aspect of that person — the part that made us angry
- **When we take time to consider all the many elements and processes that make up a person, our anger naturally softens**
- **Hatred is never appeased by more hatred.** An angry response only leads to more anger. If you respond to anger with loving friendliness, the other person’s anger will not increase
- The response of anger is a conditioned response. If we have been trained from childhood to be patient, kind, and gentle, then loving friendliness becomes part of our life. It becomes a habit
- When someone tries to make you angry or does something to hurt you, stay with your thoughts of loving friendliness toward that person
- We don’t have to be swept away by our feelings. We can respond with wisdom rather than delusion
- With thoughts of loving friendliness we appreciate the success of others with warm feeling. We not only make life more pleasant for those around us, our own lives become peaceful and happy

### Appendix: The Context of the Tradition

- The mediator learns to watch changes occurring in all physical experiences, feelings, and perceptions, and learns to study his or her own mental activities
- **Meditation is a living activity, an inherently experiential activity**
