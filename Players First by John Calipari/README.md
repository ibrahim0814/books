## Players First: Coaching From The Inside Out by John Calipari

### Introduction: The Names On The Back Of The Jerseys

- **I coach for the names on the backs of they jerseys — not just the front. My players. They are sent to me by their fathers, their mothers, their grandmothers, their aunts — whoever in this world raised raised them and loves them**
- It’s a burden to be responsible for other people’s children, sometimes a heavy burden
- I ask myself, Have I done everything I can to show them the importance of being grateful for what they have?
- I say to them…How are you going to help society and your community?
- My credo is “Players First"
- **Honesty and its related quality, trust, are at the very core of my coaching philosophy.** I’m straight up with my players from the moment I walk into their houses to recruit them

### Chapter 1: Making Lists, Keeping Score

- **If it matters to you, put it in writing. Write it down and give yourself a deadline**
- Coaches have to monitor themselves, their own mental well-being. The most intense pressure we feel is self-induced
- I tell my guys now: “You’ve got to love the grind.” And keep track of it all, because it keeps you honest. If there’s not something measurable, it’s not real
- **You can quickly improve your skills if you’re willing to spend time.** You learn three or four moves, you practice them, and it can happen fast if you really zero in on it
- **You control your own destiny. It’s up to you**
- Basketball is an intimate sport. Think about some of the words we use. Sharing the ball. Sacrificing for teammates. Helping on defense. It’s the same words you use in relation to family. It’s all about shared responsibility
- Character matters probably a little more than it does in other sports
- Play the game the right way. Care about one another. Keep the commitments you’re made to your teammates
- [Coach Cal talking about difficult off-court situations with players] You look back and hope you gave good advice, that your words of comfort were the right words
- [Coach Cal thinking to himself while considering the possibility of pulling a player off the team] How would I want my own son to be treated?
- **I do believe that anybody is helped if they have a belief in a higher power. I don’t know how you get through life without that**
- Nothing I need to get across on my practice court is important enough to violate a young man’s human dignity
- My belief is that certain people can’t get up on top of the ladder on their own, so they want to drag somebody else down
- **The guy who tries to stab you — you’re supposed to say, “Look, I forgive you,” and then you move on. That’s what you’re taught**

### Chapter 2: Just Two Words

- **I measure my success by the success of those whom I’m serving. Do those served grow as persons? Do they, while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants**
- I wrote earlier that honesty — by which I mean straight talk— is the essential element of Players First. If you BS your players, you’ll get that in return
- The dribble drive is a departure from traditional basketball, which is five passes before you shoot, or four or five screens before you create a shot for a team member
- Dribble drive = anywhere I catch the ball and begin to drive to the basket, I will have a lane completely to the rim; there shouldn’t be any offensive player in my way if I drive. If a defensive player other than the one guarding me jumps in the lane, I should have an open man
- Practice is where we work on our players’ weaknesses; games are where we show our players’ strengths
- **My most successful college teams take ownership at some point in the season.** It’s their team. They don’t play for me, they play for one another. They lean on one another. They feel their own power
- However we want to play, we impose that on the opponent

### Chapter 3: The Kentucky Effect

- I’m not in the business of sugarcoating anything. **I’m not protecting you. I can’t protect you**
- We have NBA scouts and team executives in our gym at every practice

### Chapter 4: Knocking On The Door

- We hadn’t yet figured out how to close games, which is typical of young teams

### Chapter 5: Champions At Last

- **Certain players just naturally elevate the entire group**
- What I want is to visually be able to see is that we’re getting better. Are we correcting our errors? Is what we’re doing in practice carrying over into games? Are we playing the right way?
- Ideally, you want a point per possession, and if you achieve that, you’re doing pretty well. On defense you’re trying to hold the opponent under a point — .75 or .8 per possession
- Even in the NBA, where the three-point arc is farther out, most of the best teams are near the top in three point shots attempted and percentage of three-pointers made
- **I also believe that if you don’t slow down and take stock sometimes, you’re never going to feel good about yourself**
- The best players I’ve coached have a demeanor about them that never moves. They have a calmness. You can’t read the score on their faces
- I keep it really simple when I talk to the team before games. We go over our assignments. I tell them how I think the game will be played
- **Part of coaching is acting. It’s true of any kind of leadership, whether you’re a CEO, an army general or a father. Part of the job is that you don’t reveal your own apprehensions**
- You want to win with grace, and if you’re a decent person you should be able to do that. You credit your opponents. You don’t gloat. You teach your players to handle it that way. But you want to be able to accept losses without anger or bitterness, and it’s not always easy when someone puts a microphones in your face seconds after the buzzer

### Chapter 6: Decision Time [no notes]

### Chapter 7: The Trouble With One And Done [no notes]

### Chapter 8: Humbled

- (Talking about his 2013-14 team) You have to try to figure out, What did I do to cause this? What didn’t I see? Why couldn’t I get through to my team? What do I have to change to make sure it doesn’t happen again?
- (Talking about his 2013-14 team) I had not succeeded in getting them to love the grind
- (General basketball advice) When you catch the ball do the old “one thousand one” count. That will give you time to lift your head. If there is a pick coming it will allow your teammate to get there before you start moving - Ib
- Sprint wide = run down the sideline to create proper spacing - Ib
- If you have teammates with you, try to get in the lane, then create a shot for one of them
- Even when we won, I wasn’t fully satisfied, which is how you’re supposed to coach. You’re happy, but you ask for more
- One day, instead of having a basketball practice, we played dodgeball
- (Talking about his 2013-14 team) My primary failure was that I did not put together a roster that made my kids compete against one another. Nothing in my Players First philosophy says that I should protect kids from competition. It’s just the opposite. I serve them by giving them competition
- **You have to know how to fight and take care of yourself. I can’t do that for you**
- Teams that have a good mix of talent and leadership and depth — and play really hard — can sometimes rally after an injury takes away their best player
- If you get chased off your college team because you’re afraid of the competition, you have no chance of making it in the NBA. None
- Yeah, I’ve got that part of me that sometimes wants revenge and I try my best to keep it under control, but it is never, never directed against a kid I coach or have coached
- **I know my life changed when I made it about other people. It doesn’t come naturally for kids to have that attitude**
- If you’re a parent, you know how it goes with your own kids — you tell them something and they might not get it right away. You don’t even think they paid attention. But a month later, a year later, you’ll see them act in a certain way and think, Oh yeah, they actually were listening

### Chapter 9: Recruiting At A Non Traditional Program

- **A salesman who’s a fake isn’t a very good salesman — or at least he’s not good at selling to intelligent people.** It’s about results, referrals, and relationships
- **I used to take every opportunity I had to hit back at people, but the older I get, the less I want to be in mud fights**
- The quality I’m looking for in a kid is respect. You need to be able to give respect
- **(Talking about all-time greats in the basketball world…LeBron, Jordan etc.) They keep grinding to get more championships and to get better individually because that’s what’s inside them**
- We go into any recruiting situation with our eyes wide open
- **“We all go down together, and we all come up together”** - Coal Miner that Coach Cal references

### Chapter 10: I Don’t Do This Alone

- What we do is not all about the program; it's about everyone within it. **Nothing we accomplish is worth a thing if people are not appreciated and treated correctly**
- I need people who look at adversity as a challenge and failure as a learning opportunity. I need people with an attitude that we either win or we learn
- **I have to have people with integrity**
- If someone can come in and change my way of thinking for the better, I’m all for it
- I don’t know if you’ve ever seen the way certain former pro athletes carry themselves. Their whole body language, every step they take, sort of says, Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am all that
- **It doesn’t matter how old you are or what you think you’ve accomplished. You don’t know everything. You get stupider because you stop listening. Nobody can tell you anything**
- One hope I have is that my players see these efforts and get a lesson in humility. They see that their coach reaches out for help. It doesn’t make me weak; it makes me better at everything I do
- You can be the world’s greatest basketball tactician, but if you can’t show your love to players, you won’t ever get the best from them

### Chapter 11: At War? Common Sense Verses The NCAA

- Sometimes you can take the measure of a person, or an organization, by how willing they are to go to war over stuff that doesn’t matter
- The NCAA will soon have to reform itself or it will not remain the dominant force in college athletics

### Chapter 12: Fail Fast

- You recruit kids, watch them play, get to know them, but you never truly know what you have until they’re on campus and on your practice court

### Chapter 13: The Long Road To The Final Four — And The Road Ahead

- **When you struggle and experience failure, you find out if you truly believe in your core principals**
- Players First. I’ve got their backs. My job is to love them. Their job is to love each other
