## Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions by Dan Ariely

### Introduction

* **This book is about human irrationality — about our distance from perfection**
* Understanding irrationality is important for our everyday actions and decisions
* Our irrationality happens the same way, again and again
* We are really far less rational than standard economic theory assumes

### Chapter 1: The Truth About Relativity

* Everything is relative, even when it shouldn’t be
* **Humans rarely choose things in absolute terms. We focus on the relative advantage of one thing over another, and estimate value accordingly**
* Most people don’t know what they want unless they see it in context. Like an airplane pilot landing in the dark, we want runway lights on either side of us, guiding us to the place where we can touch down our wheels
* When we have 3 options that are hard to compare, we get confused and usually pick the middle one - Ib
* If everything is relative…then what irrational choices are you making based on the wrong comparisons? - Ib
* **We are always looking at the things around us in relation to others. We can’t help it. We do it for ephemeral things as well: emotions, attitudes, and points of view**
* We tend to focus on comparing things that easily comparable and avoid comparing things that cannot be compared easily
* Decoy effect: If given 3 choices, 2 of which are easily comparable, and of the 2, 1 is clearly better than the other, then we choose the better of the 2, completely ignoring the 3rd option. A, -A, B…you’ll choose A all the time because you can easily  compare it to -A
* Comparing yourself to other people is bullshit - Ib
* We can control the circles around us, moving forward smaller circles that boost our relative happiness
* It’s easy for a person to add $200 to a $5000 catering bill for a soup entree
* **The more we have, the more we want. And the only cure is to break the cycle of relativity**

### Chapter 2: The Fallacy of Supply and Demand

* **In order to make a man covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain**
* Do our first impressions and decisions become imprinted? Assel (a black perl seller) “anchored” his pearls to the finest gems in the world — and the prices followed forever after 
* Why do we accept anchors? Once people are willing to pay a certain price for one product, their willingness to pay for other items in the same product category was judged relative to that first price (the anchor)
* Price tags by themselves are not necessarily anchors. They become anchors when we contemplate buying a product or service at that particular price. That’s when the imprint is set. From then on, we are willing to accept a range of prices — but as with the pull of a bungee cord, we always refer back to the original anchor. Thus the first anchor influences not only the immediate buying decisions but many others that follow
* Anchoring influences all kinds of purchases. People who move to a new city generally remain anchored to the prices they pain for housing in their former city
* **Do we hop from one anchor to another? It seems not. Our first decisions resonate over a long sequence of decisions**
* Herding: when we assume that something is good or bad on the basis of other people’s previous behavior, and our own actions follow suit
* The power of the first decision can have such a long-lasting effect that it will percolate into our future decisions for years to come
* The sensitivity we show to prices changes might in fact be largely a result of our memory for the prices we have paid in the past and our desire for coherence with our past decisions
* Sometimes we want our decisions to have a rational veneer when, in fact, they stem from a gut feeling — what we crave deep down
* **Following our gut feelings and rationalizing after the fact is not always bad** 

### Chapter 3: The Cost of Zero Cost

* It’s no secret that getting something free feels very good. Zero is not just another price, it turns out. **Zero is an emotional hot button — a source of irrational excitement** 
* **When something is FREE! we forget the downside. I think it’s because humans are intrinsically afraid of loss.** The real allure of FREE! is tied to this fear
* In the land of pricing, zero is NOT just another price
* When choosing between two products, we often overreact to the free one
* Free = short term thinking. Always think for the long term - Ib
* **The concept of zero also applies to time. Time spend on one activity, after all, is time taken away from another.** So if we spend 45 minutes in a line waiting for our turn to get FREE! taste of ice cream, or if we spend half an hour filling our a long form for a tiny rebate, there is something else that we are not doing with our time
* The difference between two cents and one cent is small. But the difference between one cent and zero is huge! If you are in business and understand that you can do some marvelous things. Want to sell more products? Make part of the purchase free
* Take for example the common experience of going to a restaurant with friends. FREE! can help us solve this problem. We feel more pain of paying as the bill increases, but every additional dollar on the bill pains us less. Thus, the pain of paying does not increase linearly
* When we make choices, we consider relative value instead of absolute value - Ib
* **The price of zero plays a unique role in our decisions**

### Chapter 4: The Cost of Social Norms

* **We live simultaneously in two different worlds — one where social norms prevail, and the other where market norms make the rules. The social norms include the friendly requests that people make of one another. The second world, the one governed by market norms, is very different. The exchanges are sharp edged: wages, prices, rents, interest, and costs.** 
* When we mix up social norms and market norms in our head bad things tend to happen - Ib
* A small cost causes us significantly less joy than no cost —> when giving and receiving 
* There are many examples to show that people will work more for a cause than for cash. In one experiment, instead of asking lawyers whether they would offer their services for a discounted price volunteers asked if they would offer free services to the needy — overwhelmingly the lawyers said yes
* Maybe paying my parents back for college violates social norms - Ib
* No one is offended by a small gift, because even small gifts keep us in the social exchange world and away from market norms
* For market norms to emerge, it is sufficient to mention money (even when no money changes hands) 
* Life pro tip: Don’t even mention the word money in social situations - Ib
* **Suddenly switching from social norms to market norms can have detrimental long lasting effects - Ib**
* Social relationships are not easy to reestablish. Once the bloom is off the rose — once a social norm is trumped by a market norm — it will rarely return
* If you’re a company, my advice is to remember that you can’t have it both ways. You can’t treat your customers like family one moment and then treat them impersonally — or even worse, as a nuisance or a competitor — a moment later when this becomes more convenient or profitable. This is not how social relationships work. 
* If employees promise to work harder they must get something similar in return — something like support when they are sick or a chance to hold onto their jobs when the market threatens to take their jobs away. Medical benefits and in particular comprehensive medical coverage are among the best ways a company can express its side of the social exchange 
* **If corporations stated thinking in terms of social norms they would realize that these norms build loyalty** 
* **Social norms are the forces that can make a difference in the long run**
* Money, as it turns out, is very often the most expensive way to motivate people. Social norms are not only cheaper but often more effective as well.
* On Burning Man: Money is not accepted at Burning Man. Rather, the whole place works as a gift exchange economy — you give things to other people, with the understanding that they will give something back to you
* Remember that social norms can play a far greater role in society than we have been giving them credit for
* If you want to demonstrate affection, or strengthen your relationship, then giving a gift — even at the risk that it won’t be appreciated as much as you hoped — is the only way to go
* **While gifts are financially inefficient they are an important social lubricant**
* For many people the workplace is not just a source of money also a source of motivation and self-definition
* Gifts and employee benefits seem, at first glance, to be an odd and inefficient way of allocating resources. But with the understanding that they fulfill an important role in creating long-term relationships, reciprocity, and positive feelings, companies should try to keep benefits and gifts in the social realm

### Chapter 5: The Power of a Free Cookie

* When we offer people a financial payment in a situation that is governed by social norms, the added payment could actually reduce their motivation to engage and help out
* **In economic exchanges, we are perfectly selfish and unfair. And we think that following our wallets is the right thing to do**
* **When price is not part of the exchange, we become less selfish maximizers and start caring more about the welfare of others.** 
* We are caring social animals, but when the rules of the game involve money, this tendency is muted
* The communal plate transforms the food into a shared resource and once something is part of the social good, it leads us into the realm of social norms and with that the rules for sharing with others
* Whenever price is not a part of the exchange, social norms get entangled
* **Not mentioning price ushers in social norms, and with those social norms, we start caring more about others**

### Chapter 6: The Influence of Arousal

* **Dan mentions that we exist in two emotional states: ‘hot' and ‘cold'. In a ‘cold' state, we usually underestimate the influence of our emotions when predicting our actions in a ‘hot’ state - Ib**
* The desire to engage in a variety of somewhat odd sexual activities would be nearly twice as high as participants had predicted when they were ‘cold'
* Participants themselves did not know what they were like once aroused. Prevention, protection, conservatism and morality disappears completely from the radar screen
* **Every one of us, regardless of how ‘good’ we are, under predicts the effect of passion on our behavior**
* We all systematically under predict the degree to which arousal completely negates our superego, and the way emotions can take control of our behavior
* We make strange, irrational decisions when we are emotionally charged - Ib
* Dan mentions the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde - we’re kinda like Mr. Hyde under the influence of arousal and emotions
* (With regards to having safe sex) Avoiding temptation altogether is easier than overcoming it in the heat of the moment. This just means being prepared. - Ib
* To make informed decisions we need to somehow experience and understand the emotional state we will be in at the other side of the experience. We need to understand the cold state and the hot state. 
* **Just being aware that we are prone to making the wrong decisions when gripped by intense emotion may help us**

### Chapter 7: The Problem of Procrastination and Self-Control

* **Giving up on our long term goals for immediate gratification, my friends, is procrastination**
* Although almost everyone has problems with procrastination, those who recognize and admit their weakness are in a better position to utilize available tools for recommitment and by doing so help themselves overcome it
* **Resisting temptation and instilling self-control are general human goals, and repeatedly failing to achieve them is a source of much of our misery. Without pre-commitments, we keep on falling for temptations**
* Everyone knows that preventive medicine is generally more cost-effective —for both individuals and society — than our current remedial approach
* Most of us find the allure of immediate gratification so strong that it wrecks our best-laid plans for dieting, saving money, cleaning the house — the list is endless
* (TMYK) Men benefit from marriage more than women
* If a particular behavior results in an immediate negative outcome, this behavior will be very difficult to promote, even if the ultimate outcome is highly desirable. It is useful to look for tricks that match immediate, powerful, and positive reinforcements with the not so pleasant steps we have to take toward our long term objectives 
* **About half of us will make a lifestyle decision that will ultimately lead us to an early grave**
* By pairing something that we love with something that we dislike but that is good for us, we might be able to harness desire with outcome

### Chapter 8: The High Price of Ownership

* **We tend to overvalue what we own**
* We focus on what we may lose rather than what we may gain
* Our aversion to loss is a strong emotion, and as I will explain later in the book, one that sometimes causes us to make bad decisions
* **We assume that other people will see the transaction from he the same perspective as we do**
* The ‘Ikea Affect’: he more work you put into something the more ownership you being to feel for it
* A widespread marketing hook is the “30-day money back guarantee”. You’re not returning that shit, you know it - Ib
* Everywhere around us we see the temptation to improve the quality of our lives by buying a larger home, a second car, a new dishwasher, a lawn mower and so on. While moving up in life, we indulge ourselves with the fantasy that we can always ratchet ourselves back if need be, but in reality we can’t
* **My approach (Dan’s approach) is to view all transactions (particularly large ones) as if I were a non owner, putting some distance between myself and the item of interest**
* We overvalue everything that we own, whether it’s a pair of basketball tickets or our domiciles
* **Our propensity to overvalue what we own is a basic human bias**, and it reflects a more general tendency to fall in love with and be overly optimistic about anything that has to do with ourselves
* (Advice from Dan) We can realize that we have such biases and listen more carefully to the advice and feedback we get from others

### Chapter 9: Keeping Doors Open

* **Options distract us from achieving the main objective** 
* Normally, we cannot stand the idea of closing doors on our alternatives
* **We might not always be aware of it, but in every case we give something up for those options. It’s a fool’s game and we’re remarkably adept at playing it.**
* Why do we feel compelled to keep as many doors open as possible, even at great expense? How can we unshackle ourselves from this irrational impulse to chase worthless options? 
* People are beset not by a lack of opportunity, but by a dizzying abundance of it
* The bigger doors (or those that seem bigger) are harder to close. Jobs, dreams, relationships etc.
* We have an irrational compulsion to keep doors open. It’s just the way we’re wired. 
* Choosing between two things that are similarly attractive is one of the most difficult decisions we can make
* **When we focus on the similarities and minor differences between two things we fail to take into account the consequences of not deciding - Ib**

### Chapter 10: The Effect of Expectations

* Dan is trying to explore how previously held impressions can cloud our point of view
* If you tell people up front that something might be distasteful, the odds are good that they will end up agreeing with you — not because their experience tells them so but because of their expectations. This is useful because if you know the other person has no experience dealing with the current situation you can heavily influence their reality  - Ib
* The better the ambiance of something, the more we tend to elevate its value - Ib
* Telling people slightly terrible information after they’ve had a chance to form good positive impressions is the way to go. Telling people before influences them negatively - Ib
* **Expectations and unfounded assumptions can influence nearly every aspect of our life - Ib**
* **Presentation is almost as important as the product, never underestimate it’s power - Ib**
* That’s what marketing is all about — praising information that will heighten someone’s anticipated and real pleasure
* The brain cannot start from scratch at every new situation. It must build on what it has been before. Research on stereotypes shows not only that we react differently when we have a stereotype of a certain group of people, but also that stereotyped people themselves react differently when they are aware of the label that they are forced to wear
* Our own behavior can be influenced by our stereotypes, and that activation of stereotypes can depend on our current state of mind and how we view ourselves at that moment  
* When stripping away our preconceptions and our previous knowledge is not possible, perhaps **we can at least acknowledge that we are all biased. If we acknowledge that we are trapped within our perspective, which partially blinds us to the truth we may be able to accept the idea that conflicts generally require a neutral third party** — who has not been tainted with our expectations
* Expectation is an important part of how we experience everything - Ib
* In the absence of expertise or perfect information, we look for social cues to help us figure out how much we are, or should be impressed, and our expectations take care of the rest
* Uplift people with your high expectations of them but don’t make them unreasonable. **Success is heavily influenced by people’s beliefs in you - Ib**

### Chapter 11: The Power of Price

* **Our expectations can affect us by altering our subjective and even objective experiences — sometimes profoundly so**
* Before recent times, almost all medicines were placebos. The truth is that placebos run on the power of suggestion. They are effective because people believe in them
* Two mechanisms shape the expectations that make placebos work. One is belief — our confidence or faith in the drug, the procedure, or the caregiver. The second mechanism is conditioning - the body builds up expectancy after repeated experiences 
* If we see a discounted item, we will instinctively assume that its quality is less than that of a full-price item — and then in fact we will make it so
* **Placebos represent the amazing ways in which our mind controls our body - Ib**
* Placebos are all about self-fulfilling prophecies 

### Chapter 12: The Cycle of Distrust

* We’ve become distrustful — not only of those who are trying to swindle us but of everyone
* **Trust, like money, is a crucial lubricant for the economy** 
* Without constant suspicion, we can get more out of our exchanges with others while spending less time making sure that others will fulfill their promises to us
* Most people and companies miss or ignore the fact that trust is an important public resource and that losing it can have long-term negative consequences for everyone involved
* **Widespread distrust also makes it more difficult for us to believe those who truly deserve to be trusted**
* Small lies add up to big problems - Ib
* It appears that mistrust in marketing information runs so deeply that it colors our entire perception even in the face of firsthand, direct experience
* Special companies see trust as a public good (like clean air and water)
* Trust, once eroded, is very hard to restore
* By coming to understand trust as an important, tangible, public resource to be protected and cared for, organizations could do a great deal to restore it
* Honesty, transparency, conscientiousness and fair dealing should be bedrock corporate principals

### Chapter 13: The Context of Our Character, Part I

* **When given the opportunity, many honest people will cheat**
* Even when we have no chance of getting caught, we still don’t become wildly dishonest
* **Adam Smith: The success of most people…almost always depends upon the favor and good opinion of their neighbors and equals**
* Honestly is something that is considered a moral virtue in nearly every society
* Once they begin thinking about honestly — whether by recalling the 10 Commandments or by signing a simple statement — participants stop cheating completely
* Occasional swearing of oaths and occasional statements of adherence to rules are not enough. From our experiments, it is clear that oaths and rules must be recalled at, or just before, the moment of temptation
* **What can we do to keep our country honest? We can read the Bible, the Quran, or whatever reflects our values, perhaps. We can revive professional standards. We can sign our names to promises that we will act with integrity**

### Chapter 14: The Context of Our Character, Part II

* **When we look at the world around us, much of the dishonesty we see involves cheating that is one step removed from cash**
* It’s often hard to get a clear picture of how non monetary objects influence our cheating
* We cheat far more often and far more egregiously for things that are 1 step removed from cash - Ib
* **Honesty = long term monetary returns**
* Even good people are not immune to being partially blinded by their own minds. This blindness allows them to take actions that bypass their own moral standards on the road to financial rewards

### Chapter 15: Beer and Free Lunches

* **We are not noble in reason, not infinite in faculty, and rather weak in apprehension**
* People are sometimes willing to sacrifice the pleasure they get from a particular consumption experience in order to project a certain image to others
* People, particularly those with a high need for uniqueness may sacrifice personal utility to gain repetitional utility
* We are all far less rational in our decision making than standard economic theory assumes 
* **People are susceptible to irrelevant influences from their immediate environment (context effects), irrelevant emotions, shortsightedness, and other forms of irrationality**
* If I were to distill one main lesson from the research described in this book, it is that **we are pawns in a game whose forces we largely fail to comprehend.** We usually think of ourselves as sitting in the driver’s seat with ultimate control over the decision we make and the direction our life takes, but alas, this perception has more to do with our desires and with how we want to view ourselves — than with reality
