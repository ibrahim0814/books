# Books
This is a repository containing notes from books I've read! My aim is to synthesize the most important quotes and concepts from any piece of text I've read such that when I want to refresh myself on the contents again, I (and hopefully others!) can do so very quickly. 

## Process
I directly transcribe self-underlined or self-highlighted sentences from the book's pages so most of everything contained inside the notes are quotations. There's also a healthy mix of commentary where context is sparse for clarification purposes.

Initially, I thought about just attaching PDFs of my notes and dump them in this repo. But to be frank, this approach is infelxible because oftentimes I want to change and iterate on the notes I've already taken. Instead, I've chosen to convert those notes to .md files which can then be exported in any format for consumption elsewhere. I've done my best to organize these .md files in a way that's easy to consume, but as with all markdown files, formatting options are limited. Feel free to download and modify your own copies of these notes as you wish!

## Repo Updates
I anticipate I'll update this repository every 2-2.5 weeks with a new book. It takes a while to read and identify important quotations from a book and then type them out. It's painstaking to do, but will be useful in the long term. 

## Usage
Since most of these notes are quotations, I'm somewhat wary of copyright issues. My intention is not to cause anyone harm and if I've violated any rules by uploading these notes, please contact me.
