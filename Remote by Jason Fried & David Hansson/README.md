## Remote by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson

### The Time Is Right For Remote Work

* The office during the day has become the last place people want to be when they really want to get work done
* The ability to be alone with your thoughts is, in fact, one of the key advantages of working remotely
* Stop commuting your life away. Commuting isn’t just bad for you, your relationships, and the environment — it’s bad for business
* **The internet enables remote work to thrive. The future, quite literally, belongs to those who get it**
* A company that is efficiently built around remote work doesn’t even have to have a set schedule. Release yourself from the 9am-5pm mentality
* **The new luxury is to shed the shackles of deferred living — to pursue your passions now, while you’re still working.** What’s the point in wasting time daydreaming about how great it’ll be when you finally quit?
* The new luxury is the luxury of freedom and time. Once you’re had a taste of that life, no corner office or fancy chef will be able to drag you back
* Great talent is everywhere 
* Letting people work remotely is about promising quality of life, about getting access to the best people wherever they are, and all the other benefits we’ll enumerate 

### Dealing With Excuses

* By rationing in person meetings their stature is elevated to that of a are treat. They become something to be savored, something special
* People have an amazing ability to live down to low expectations. The bottom line is that you shouldn’t hire people you don’t trust, or work for bosses who don’t trust you
* Keep in mind, the number one counter to distractions is interesting, fulfilling work. Most people want to work, as long as it’s stimulating and fulfilling
* **Working remotely is about making things better for more people more of the time**
* Many big businesses get away with staggering amounts of inefficiency and bureaucracy
* The best way to diffuse the “everyone must be bound by the same policy” line of argument is to remind your boss, yourself, and any other concerned party that you’re all on the same team 
* What about culture? **Culture is the spoken and unspoken values and actions of the organization**:
    * How we talk to customers — are they always right
    * What quality is acceptable — good enough or must it be perfect?
    * How we talk to each other — with diplomatic tones or shouting matches?
    * Workload — do we cheer on all-nighters or take Fridays off?
    * Risk taking — do we favor bet-the-company pivots or slow growth?
* **Not every question needs an answer immediately.** That means realizing that not everything is equally important. Once you’ve grasped that, you’re truly on the path to enlightenment and productivity. 80% of you’re questions aren’t so time-sensitive after all
* The thinking goes: If I can’t see them, I can’t control them. Wresting that antiquated notion of control away from managers isn’t a logical or rational process. It’s often something that needs to be slow-walked 

### How To Collaborate Remotely

* We’ve found that we need a good four hours of overlap to avoid collaboration delays and feel like a team
* **Put all the important stuff out in the open, and no one will have to chase that wild goose to get their work done** 
* We all need mindless breaks and it helps if you spend some of them with your team. That’s where the virtual water cooler comes in. The wonderful thing about a chat room is that it doesn’t require constant attention. People check in and check out during the day at natural breaks points
* To instill a sense of company cohesion and to share forward motion, everyone needs to feel the that they’re in the loop - we’ve institutionalized this through a weekly discussion thread with the subject “What have you been working on?”. It simply aims to make everyone feel like they’re in the same galley and not their own little rowboat. It’s also a lot harder to bullshit your peers than your boss
* **The work is what matters. The secret benefit of hiring remote workers is that the work itself becomes the yardstick to judge someone’s performance.** When you can’t see someone all day long, the only thing you have to evaluate is the work
* If you’re an owner or manager, letting local people work remotely is a great first step toward seeing if remote will work for you 
* M&Ms = Managers and Meetings. Take it easy on those M&Ms
* **Meeting should be like salt — sprinkled carefully to enhance a dish, not poured recklessly over every forkful.** Too much salt destroys a dish. Too many meetings can destroy morale and motivation
* Managers are good. They’re essential. But management, like meetings, should be used sparingly
* Cabin fever is real and remote workers are more susceptible to it than those forced into an office
* If you’re going to make a real go at working from home for the long term, you’ll need to get the ergonomic basics right. That means getting a proper desk, a proper chair, and a proper screen (27 inches)
* Working with clients
    * Provide references before the client even asks. Show right up front that you have nothing to hide. Trust is going to be the toughest thing to build early on
    * Show them work often. This is the best way to chip away at a client’s natural situational anxiety

### Hiring And Keeping The Best

* Once you’ve formed good remote working habits, the lack of proximity between coworkers will start mattering so little that you’ll forget exactly where people are 
* Carabi + Co.’s CEO purposely hires remote workers in other parts of the world because he feels having an international team helps him win clients
* **You need solid writers to make remote work work and a solid command of your home language is key**
* **Given how hard it is to find great people, you should be doing your utmost to keep them**
* People who’ve been with a company for a long time make ideal remote workers
* **Keeping a solid team together for a long time is a key to peak performance.** People grow closer and more comfortable with each other, and consequently do even better work. Meanwhile, rookie teams make rookie mistakes
* **It doesn’t take much for bad blood to develop. That’s one of the key challenges of remote work: keeping everyone’s outlook healthy and happy.** That task is insurmountable if you’ve stacked your team with personalities who tend to let their inner asshole loose even now and again 
* **Hire people who go out of their way to make sure everyone is having a good time.** Good sentiments are infectious. It’s never a good idea to let poisonous people stick around to spoil it for everyone else, but in a remote work setup it’s deadly 
* A manager of remote workers needs to make an example of even the small stuff — things like snippy comments or passive-aggressive responses
* The old adage still applies: No assholes allowed. But for remote work, you need to extend it to no asshole-y behavior allowed, no drama allowed, no bad vibes allowed
* **Put a team together who are naturally interested in more than just their work — and it continues with encouraging those other interests to bloom.** We’ve also sponsored the pursuit of a long list of hobbies and made sure that people get the time off to for them in. Few companies give their workers both the time off to pursue their hobbies and the financial support to make them affordable 
* (On hiring) Asking to see work product is pretty easy for positions with natural portfolios, such as designer, programmer, or writer. It’s the work that matters. Look at the work and forget the abstractions
* As a remote worker, you shouldn’t let employees get away with paying you less just because you live in a cheaper city
* **Great remote workers are simply great workers. They exhibit the two key qualities, as Joel Spolsky labeled them in his “Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing”: Smart and Get Things Done**
* In hiring for remote-working positions, managers should be ruthless in filtering out poor writers. Thankfully, becoming a better writer is entirely possible. You should read, read, and read some more. Study how good writers make their case. Focus on clarity first, style second
* The best way we’ve found to accurately judge work is to hire the person to do a little work before we take the plunge and hire them to do a lot of work. Call it “pre-hiring”. Pre-Hiring takes the form of a one or two week mini project. We usually pay around $1,500 for the mini project. Whatever it is, make it meaningful. Make it about creating something ew that solves a problem
* The next step is figuring out if they’re the right fit culturally. Are they polite? Do they show up on time? Are they fundamentally decent? Do they treat people well? What does the rest of the team think? **In the end we make the call on talent and character. It’s always a blend**
* Contractors know the drill: set a reasonable schedule, show good progress at regular intervals and convert an often fuzzy definition of the work into a deliverable
* Contract work is an excellent way for both the company doing the hiring and the person being hired to ease into remote work and try it on for size 

### Managing Remote Workers

* **Cultures grow over time, and it’ll be a lot easier if your culture grows up with remote workers**
* The job of a manager is not to herd cows, but to lead and verify the work. You can’t effectively manage a team if you don’t know the intricacies of what they’re working on 
* There’s no reason not to get together every now and then. In fact, it’s almost mandatory to do so occasionally
* It’s just easier to work remotely with people you’ve met in so-called “real-life” — folks you’ve shared laughs and meals with
* Going to an industry conference is another good opportunity for team bonding 
* If you treat remote workers like second-class citizens you’re all going to have a bad time. Maintain a level playing field — one on which those in and out of the office stand as equals 
* It’s a good idea to check in a bit more frequently with remote workers 
* **Remove the roadblocks. Start by empowering everyone to amen decisions on their own. People are often scared to make a decision because they work in an environment of retribution and blame** 
* **You must make sure that people have access, by default, to everything they need.** Most companies start out by adopting the reverse policy. Part of the problem is the occasional pride that managers take in being Mr. or Ms. Roadblock. Having to be asked — even courted — gives them a certain perverse satisfaction 
* At 37Signals everyone gets a company credit card and is told to “spend wisely"
* If work is all consuming the worker is far more likely to burn out. Responsibility lies with the managers and business owners to set the tone. From May to October, we give everyone an additional weekday off — more time to spend outside while the weather is nice and a good way to decompress from a hard-work winter. The best workers over the long term are people who put in sustainable hours
* **When something is scarce, we tend to conserve, appreciate, respect, and value it. Abundance and value are often opposites** 
* **When meetings occur all the time, they begin to lose their value.** The scarcity of such face time in remote working situations makes it seem that much more valuable 

### Life As A Remote Worker

* Without clear boundaries and routines, things can get murky
* **It can also be helpful to separate the clothes you wear, depending whether you’re in work or play mode**
* Divide the day into chucks like: Catch-up, Collaboration, Serious Work
* Make sure that real work only happens when you’re in your dedicated home office
* **The gray line between work and play can be hard to see on the best of days. A simple strategy is to separate the two completely by using different devices: simply reserve one computer for work and another for fun**
* Getting away from the office is great for your productivity because nobody can disturb you in person. Take your laptop and head to the nearest coffee shop with wifi. The presence of other people, even if you don’t know then, can fool your mind into thinking that being productive is the only proper thing to do
* **The only reliable way to muster motivation is by encouraging people to work on the stuff they like and care about, with people they like and care about**
* “When I retire, I’m going to travel the world” is a common dram, but why wait for retirement? Creative work that can be done remotely generally only requires a computer and an internet connection
* **Routine has a tendency to numb your creativity. Changes of scenery, however, can lead to all sorts of new ideas**
* Having family close and available is a good way to counterbalance the loss of daily in-person contact with coworkers 
* Working remotely doesn’t have to mean working from home. Co-working spaces are also an option
* **There are two fundamental ways not to be ignored at work: make noise or make progress. Do the latter - Ib**

### Conclusion 

* **Remote work is here, and it’s here to stay.** The only question is whether you’ll be part of the early adopters, the early majority, the late majority, the laggards
