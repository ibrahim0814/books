## Rework by Jason Fried & David Heinemeier Hansson 

### First

* **There’s a new reality. Today anyone can be in business.** Tools that used to be out of reach are now easily accessible. Stuff that was impossible just a few years ago is simple today

### Takedowns 

* Ignore the real world. The real world isn’t a place, its an excuse. It’s a justification for not trying. It has nothing to do with you
* Learning from mistakes is overrated. **Failure is not a prerequisite for success.** Success is the experience that actually counts
* Start referring to your business plans as business guesses, your financial plans as financial guesses, and your strategic plans as strategic guesses. Now you can stop worrying about them as much
* **Plans are inconsistent with improvisation. And you have to be able to improvise**
* You have the most information when you’re doing something, not before you’ve done it
* Don’t make assumptions about how big you should be ahead of time. Grow slow and see what feels right — premature hiring is the death of many companies
* **Working more doesn’t mean you care more or get more done.** It just means you work more
* If all you do is work, you’re unlikely to have sound judgements. No one makes sharp decisions when tired

### Go

* **Make a dent in the universe** 
* To do great work, you need to feel that you’re making a difference. Your efforts need to feel valuable. You should feel an urgency about this too. What you do is your legacy
* **If you’re going to do something, do something that matters**
* The easiest, most straightforward way to create a great product or service is to make something you want to use
* **Start making something.** What you do is what matters, to what you think or say or plan
* No time is no excuse. When you want something bad enough, you make the time — regardless of your other obligations
* **You have to believe in something. You need to have a backbone. You need to know what you’re willing to fight for. And then you need to show the world**
* Standing for something isn’t just about writing it down. It’s about believing it and living it
* No matter what kind of business you’re starting, take on as little outside cash as you can
* **You need less than you think.** There’s nothing wrong with being frugal
* Start a business, not a startup. Turn a profit or wind up gone. Startups try to ignore this reality. A business without a path to profit isn’t a business, it’s a hobby
* You should be thinking about how to make your project grow and succeed, not how you’re going to jump ship
* When you build a company with the intention of being acquired, you emphasize the wrong things
* Embrace the idea of having less mass. If you keep your mass low, you can quickly change anything 

### Progress 

* **Embrace constraints.** Limited resources force you to make do with what you’re got. There’s no room for waste. And that forces you to be creative
* It’s hard enough to do one thing right. So start chopping. Getting to great starts by cutting out stuff that’s merely good
* When you start anything new, there are forces pulling you in a variety of directions. The stuff you have t  do is where you should begin. **Start at the epicenter. Which part of your equation can’t be removed?**
* Ignore the details early on 
* When you put off decisions, they pile up. **Decide and move forward. Make the call, make progress, and get something out there now**
* Be a curator. Stick to what’s truly essential. It’s the stuff you leave out that matters
* When things aren’t working the natural inclination is to throw more at the problem. Cut back. Do less.
* The core of your business should be built around things that won’t change. Things that people are going to want today and ten years from now (ex. reliability, affordability, practicality) 
* It’s tempting for people to obsess over tools instead of what they’re going to do with those tools. People use equipment as a crutch. They’re looking for a shortcut
* Sell your by-products. When you make something you always make something else. You can’t just make one thing. Everything has a by-product
* **Once your product does what it needs to do, get it out there.** Think about this: if you had to launch your business in two weeks, what would you cut out?

### Productivity 

* If you need to explain something, try getting real with it. Do everything you can to remove layers of abstraction
* **Get the chisel out and start making something real. Anything else is just a distraction**
* Reasons to quit 
    * There’s no motivation behind it
    * You’re solving an imaginary problem 
    * It’s not actually useful
    * You’re not adding any value
    * There’s an easier way to do it
    * How could you be spending your time instead?
* **When you’re interrupted, you’re not getting work done. Instead, you should get in the alone zone. Long stretches of alone time are when you’re most productive**
* During alone time, give up instant messages, phone calls, email, and meetings. Just shut up and get to work
* Meetings are toxic. The true cost of meetings is staggering. Let’s say you’re going to schedule a meeting that lasts one hour, and you invite ten people to attain. That’s actually a ten hour meeting, not a one-hour meeting
* **Good enough is fine.** Find a judo solution, one that delivers maximum efficiency with minimum effort. When good enough gets the job done, go for it
* **Momentum fuels motivation. To keep your momentum and motivation up, get it the habit of accomplishing small victories along the way** 
* Go to sleep. Lack of sleep results in:
    * Stubbornness 
    * Lack of creativity 
    * Diminished morale 
    * Irritability
* We humans are just plain bad at estimating. Break the big thing into smaller things. The smaller it is, the easier it is to estimate. Keep breaking your time frames down into smaller chucks
* Long lists don’t get done. Long lists are guilt trip. Whenever you can, divide problems into smaller and smaller pieces until you’re able to deal with them completely and quickly
* **Make tiny decisions. Make choices that are small enough that they’re effectively temporary**

### Competitors

* Copying is a formula for failure. Copying skips understanding — and understanding is how you grow. Plus, if you’re a copycat, you can never keep up. You’re always in a passive position
* Inject what’s unique about the way you think into what you sell
* **Under do your competition.** When you get suckered into an arms race, you wind up in a never ending battle that costs you massive amount of money, time and drive
* **Focus on competitors too much and you wind up diluting your own vision. Focus on yourself instead**

### Evolution

* **Start getting into the habit of saying no — even to many of your best ideas.** Use the power of no to get your priorities straight. Don’t be a jerk. People are surprisingly understanding when you take the time to explain your point of view. You may even win them over to your way of thinking
* When you stick with your current customers come hell or high water, you wind up cutting yourself off from new ones. Scaring away new customers is worse than losing old customers
* **The enthusiasm you have for a new idea is not an accurate indicator of its true worth. By all means, have as many ideas as you can. Get excited about them. Just don’t act in the heat of the moment. Write them down and park them for a few days. Then, evaluate their priority with a calm mind**
* Don’t write it down. Customers will keep reminding you of which things you truly need to worry about 

### Promotion 

* Welcome obscurity. No one knows who you are right now. Use this time to make mistakes without the whole world hearing about them. Keep tweaking. It makes no sense to tell everyone to look at you if you’re not ready to be looked at yet
* **When you build an audience you don’t have to buy people’s attention — they give it to you.** This is a huge advantage. So build an audience. Speak, write, blog, tweet, make videos. Share information that’s valuable you’ll slowly but surely build a loyal audience
* **Out-teach your competition.** Most businesses focus on selling or servicing, but teaching never even occurs to them. Teach and you’ll form a bond you just don’t get from traditional marketing tactics. Earn loyalty by teaching
* As a business owner, you should share everything you know. This is anathema to most in the business world. Business are usually paranoid and secretive
* Give people a backstage pass and show them how your business works
* **Don’t be afraid to show your flaws. There’s beauty to imperfection** 
* Don’t be afraid to give a little away for free — as long as you’ve got something else to sell. Be confident in what you’re offering
* **Everything is marketing.** Every word you write on your website is marketing. It’s the sum total of everything you do
* Trade the dream of overnight success for slow, measured growth

### Hiring 

* **Never hire anyone to do a job until you’ve tried to do it yourself first.** Run with the ball as far as you can before handing it off 
* Don’t hire for pleasure, hire to kill pain. The right time to hire is when there’s more work than you can handle for a sustained period of time
* **You need to be able to tell people when they’re full of crap. You need an environment where everyone feels safe enough to be honest when things get tough**
* There’s surprisingly little difference between a candidate with six months of experience and one with six years. The real difference comes from the individual’s dedication, personality, and intelligence 
* The pool of great candidates is far bigger than just people who completed college with a stellar GPA
* With a small team, you need people who are going to do work, not delegate work. Everyone’s got  to be producing. No one can be above the work
* **Hire managers of one. Managers of one are people who come up with their own goals and execute them. They don’t need heavy direction. These people free you from oversight. They set their own direction**
* Hire great writers. Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking. Great writers know how to communicate. They make things easy to understand
* It’s crazy not to hire the best people just because they live far away. Having non-overlapping hours is actually better for productivity if people are in different time zones. Geography just doesn’t matter anymore
* Test-drive employees. You need to evaluate the work they can do now, not the work they say they did in the past

### Damage Control 

* When something goes wrong, someone is going to tell the story. You’ll be better off if it’s you. Otherwise, you create an opportunity for rumors, hearsay, and false information to spread
* **People will respect you more if you are open, honest, public and responsive during a crisis** 
* The message should come from the top. Spread the message far and wide. Use whatever megaphone you have
* **Speed changes everything. Getting back to people quickly is probably the most important thing you can do when it comes to customer service.** It’s amazing how much that can defuse a bad situation and turn it into a good one
* Even if you don’t have the perfect answer, say something. “Let me do some research and get back to you” can work wonders 
* “I” apology is a lot stronger than a “we” apology. The number one principal to keep in mind when you apologize: how would you feel about the apology if you were on the other end?
* Put everyone on the front lines. Everyone on your team should be connected to your customers — maybe not everyday, but at least a few times throughout the year. No one should be shielded from criticism
* **When you rock the boat there will be waves. But if you ride out that first rocky week, things usually settle down. People are creatures of habit. That’s why they react to change in such a negative way**

### Culture

* **You don’t create a culture. It happens.** That is why new companies don’t have a culture. Culture is the by product of consistent behavior. Don’t force it 
* Most of the things you worry about never happen anyways. **Optimize for now and worry about the future later**
* There’s a ton of untapped potential trapped under lame policies, poor direction, and stifling bureaucracies. Cut the crap and you’ll find that people are waiting to do great work. They just need to be given the chance
* When everything constantly needs approval, you create a culture of non thinkers. You create a boss-verses-worker relationship that screams “I don’t trust you.” Look at the costs and you quickly realize that failing to trust your employees is awful expensive
* Send people home at 5. You want busy people. People who have a life outside of work. People who care about more than one thing
* **Talk to customers the way you would talk to friends. The mask of professionalism is a joke**
* Avoid using need, can’t, and easy. These are absolutes and hinder good communication. ASAP is poison

### Conclusion

* **Inspiration is perishable.** Inspiration is now thing. If it grabs you, grab it right back and put it to work
