## The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life by Mark Manson

### Chapter 1: Don’t Try

* The dream: someone fights for what they want, never gives up  and eventually achieves their wildest dreams
* (Talking about a writer named Bukowski) The genius in Bukowski’s work...was his simple ability to be completely, unflinchingly honest with himself — especially the worst parts of himself — and to share his failings without hesitation or doubt
* Conventional life advice actually fixates on what you lack. It lasers in on what you perceive your personal shortcomings and failures to already be, and then emphasizes them for you
* The problem is that giving too many fucks is bad for your mental health
* **The key to a good life…is giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important**
* The Feedback Loop from hell: You feel so guilty for every mistake you make that you begin to feel guilty about how guilty you’re feeling. or you get sad and alone so often that it makes you feel even more sad and alone just thinking about it.
* We feel bad about feeling bad. We feel guilty for feeling guilty. We get angry about getting angry. We get anxious about feeling anxious. What is wrong with me? This is why not giving a fuck is so key
* By not giving a fuck that you feel bad, you short-circuit the Feedback Loop from Hell
* **The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.** 
* "You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life” — Albert Camus
* Pursuing the negative generates the positive
* Being open with your insecurities paradoxically makes you more confident and charismatic around others. The pain of honest confrontation is what generates the greatest trust and respect in your relationships. 
* **Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience**
* The avoidance of struggle is a struggle. The denial of failure is a failure. Hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame. 
* To try to avoid pain is to give too many fucks about pain 
* If you’re able to not give a fuck about the pain, you become unstoppable.
* **To not give a fuck is stare down life’s most terrifying and difficult challenges and still take action**
* Look, this is how it works. You’re going to die one day. And in the short amount of time between here and there, you have a limited amount of fucks to give. Very few in fact.
* Not giving a fuck means being comfortable with being different
* **(Talking about indifferent people) They’re afraid to let anyone get close to them, so they imagine themselves as some special, unique snowflake who has problems that nobody would ever understand. That’s why they don’t make any meaningful choices.** 
* (Talking about people who don’t give a fuck) Overcoming adversity, the willingness to be different, an outcast, a pariah, all for the sake of one’s own values. The willingness to stare failure in the face and shove your middle finger back at it. They know it’s more important than they are, more important than their own feelings, and their own pride and their own ego. 
* The point isn’t to get away from shit. The point is to find shit you enjoy dealing with. 
* To not give a fuck about adversity you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity 
* Finding something important and meaningful in your life is perhaps the most productive use of your time and energy
* (Talking about life’s trivial details) We realize how little people pay attention to superficial details about us and we choose not to obsess so much over them. This is something called maturity. 
* Practical enlightenment is becoming comfortable with the idea that some suffering is always inevitable — that no matter what you do, life is comprised of failures, loss, regrets, and even death. After all, the only way to overcome pain is to first learn how to bear it 
* (Talking about this book) Think of it as a guide to suffering and how to do it better

### Chapter 2: Happiness Is A Problem

* Suffering totally sucks. And it’s not necessarily that meaningful either. There is no value in suffering when it’s done without purpose.
* Life itself is a form of suffering. We all must suffer...
* (Talking about Bhuddist philosophy) Pain and loss are inevitable and we should let go of trying to resist them
* Happiness is not a solvable equation
* DISAPPOINTMENT PANDA: his superpower would be to tell people harsh truths about themselves that they needed to hear but didn’t want to accept
* After all, the greatest truths in life are usually the most unpleasant to hear
* We suffer for the simple reason that suffering is biologically useful. It is nature’s preferred agent for inspiring change
* Research has found that our brains don’t register much difference between physical pain and psychological pain
* "Life is essentially an endless series of problems” - Disappointment Panda
* **“Don’t hope for a life without problems. There is no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems” - Disappointment Panda**
* Problems are a constant in life. Problems never stop: they merely get exchanged or upgraded
* Happiness comes from solving problems. The keyword here is solving.
* **To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is therefore a form of action; it’s an activity, not something that is passively bestowed upon you, not something that you magically discover in a top-ten article on the Huffington Post**
* Happiness is a constant work-in-progress, because solving problems is a constant work in progress 
* True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving
* How not to solve problems: 1) Denial of problems 2) Victimhood mentality
* **High’s are shallow and unproductive ways to go about one’s life**
* High’s also generate addiction. The more you rely on them to feel better about your underlying problems, the more you will seek them out.
* Just because something feels good doesn’t mean it is good. Just because something feels bad doesn’t mean it is bad. We shouldn’t always trust our emotions. 
* Remember, pain serves a purpose
* Emotions never last
* Hedonic treadmill: the idea that we’re always working hard to change our life situation, but we actually never feel very different
* Whatever makes us feel good will also inevitably make us feel bad. What creates our positive experiences will define our negative experiences. 
* **A question most people never consider is, “What pain do you want in your life. What are you willing to struggle for?"**
* Most people want to have great sex and an awesome relationship, but not everyone is willing to go through the tough conversations, the awkward silences, the hurt feelings, and the emotional psychodrama to get there 
* The path to happiness is a path full of shit-heaps and shame
* (Talking about himself) I was in love with the result, but I wasn’t in love with the process. I wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love with not the fight but only the victory. And life doesn’t work that way. 

### Chapter 3: You Are Not Special

* **A true and accurate measure of one’s self-worth is how people feel about the negative aspects of themselves**
* Entitled people exude a delusional degree of self-confidence (do not let yourself feel entitled)
* But entitlement is a failed strategy. It’s just another high. It’s not happiness
* **A person who actually has self-worth is able to look at the negative parts of his character fully**
* When “real traumatic shit” happens in our lives, we begin to unconsciously feel as though we have problems that we’re incapable of ever solving. And this assumed inability to solve our problems causes us to feel miserable and helpless
* Entitlement plays out in 2 ways: 1) I’m awesome and the rest of you all suck 2) I suck and the rest of you are all awesome
* There are no insurmountable problems. That’s a lie - Ib
* If you’re got a problem, chances are millions of other people have had it in the past, have it now, and are going to have it in the future. IT JUST MEANS YOU’RE NOT SPECIAL. 
* The more exposed we are to opposing viewpoints, the more we seem to get upset that those other viewpoints exist
* **To become truly great at something, you have to dedicate shit-tons of time and energy to it**
* We’re all, for the most part, pretty average people. But it’s the extremes that get all of the publicity. 
* Our lives today are filled with information from the extremes of the bell curve of human experience. The vast majority of life is not unextraordinary, indeed  quite average. 
* The tendency toward entitlement is apparent across all of society
* The inundation of the exceptional makes people feel worse about themselves
* The internet has not just open sourced information, it has also open-sourced insecurity, self-doubt, and shame
* If everyone were extraordinary, then by definition no one would be extraordinary
* A lot of people are afraid to accept mediocrity because they believe that if they accept it, they’ll never achieve anything, never improve, and that their life won’t matter
* **People who become great at something become great because they understand that they’re not already great - they are mediocre, they are average — and that they could be so much better**

### Chapter 4: The Value of Suffering

* (Talking about lone warrior Onada and the person that found him, Suzuki) Suzuki asked Onada why he had stayed and continued to fight. Onada said it was simple: he has been given the order to “never surrender”.
* Humans often choose to dedicate large portions of their lives to seemingly useless or destructive causes
* These men both chose how they wished to suffer (Onada and Suzuki). Their suffering meant something, it fulfilled some greater cause. 
* **The question we should be asking is, “Why am I suffering - for what purpose?"**
* Self-awareness is like an onion. There are multiple layers to it, and the more you peel them back, the more likely you’re going to start crying at inappropriate times. 
* The first layer of the self-awareness onion is a simple understanding of one’s emotions. We all have emotional blind spots. It takes years of practice and effort to get good at identifying blind spots
* The second layer of the self-awareness onion is an ability to ask why we feel certain emotions. This helps us understand the root cause of the emotional that overwhelm us.
* The third level is our personal values. Values —> nature of our problems —> quality of our lives
* **Values underlie everything we do and are**
* **Everything we think and feel about a situation comes back to how valuable we perceive it to be**
* Most people are horrible at answering these why questions accurately
* Most people avoid responsibility for their own problems, rather than accurately identifying the problem. Their decisions were based on chasing highs, not generating true happiness
* How are they choosing to measure success/failure for themselves 
* Honest self-questioning is difficult 
* For any given situation you’re in, ask yourself: what is the value and what is the metric by which I’m evaluating said value - Ib
* **We get to control what our problems mean based on how we choose to think about them, the standard by which we choose to measure them**
* We’re apes. We think we’re all sophisticated. We instinctually measure ourselves against others. 
* Everyone has different metrics for evaluating success - Ib
* Our values determine the metrics by which we measure ourselves and everyone else
* If you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and how you measure failure/success
* Ask yourself: what are your values? If they’re not strong, change them/find new ones
* (Talking the dude who got replaced by Ringo) Fame and glory would have been nice, sure — but he decided that what he already had was more important: a big and loving family, a stable marriage, a simple life
* Shitty values
    * Pleasure: pleasure is a false god. Pleasure is the most superficial form of life satisfaction - the easiest to obtain and the easiest to lose
    * Material success: don’t measure yourself by status symbols - Ib
    * Always being right: if your metric for life success is to be right — well, you’re going to have a difficult time. You prevent yourself from learning from mistakes. It’s far more helpful to assume you’re ignorant and don’t know a whole lot
    * Staying positive: sometimes life sucks, and the healthiest thing you can do is admit it. Shit happens - Ib. Need to able to express negative emotions in a socially acceptable and healthy manner and express them in a way that aligns with your values. When we force ourselves to stay positive at all times, we deny the existence of our life’s problems 
* “One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful” -  Sigmund F.
* **Good values**
    * Reality based, socially constructive, immediate and controllable
    * **Honesty, innovation, vulnerability, standing up for yourself, standing up for others, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity (healthy values are achieved internally)**
* **Self improvement in a nutshell: prioritizing better values, choosing better things to give a fuck about***

### Chapter 5: You Are Always Choosing

* (Talking about running a marathon) When you choose it freely and prepare for it, it was a glorious and important milestone in your life. When it was forced upon you against your will, it was one of the most terrifying and painful experiences of your life
* The only difference between a problem being painful or being powerful is a sense that we choose it, and that we are responsible for it
* **When we feel that we’re choosing our problems, we feel empowered** 
* **We, individually, are responsible for everything in our lives, no matter the external circumstances**
* We always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond
* It’s still your responsibility to interpret the meaning of the event and choose a response
* We are always choosing
* With great responsibility comes great power
* Accepting responsibility for our problems is the first step to solving them
* People hesitate to take responsibility for their problems because they believe that to be responsible for your problems is to also be at fault for your problems
* We are responsible for experiences that aren’t our fault all the time. This is part of life. 
* **Nobody else is ever responsible for your situation but you**
* Don’t ever play victim with yourself - Ib
* Taking responsibility for our problems is far more important because that’s where the real learning comes from. That’s where the real-life improvement comes from. 
* How we react to death, or robbery, or injustice is our own choice - Ib
* (Talking about privilege) We get dealt the cards. Some of us get better cards than others 
* Nobody makes it through life without collecting a few scars on the way out
* Right now, anyone who is affected about anything is oppressed in some way. The biggest problem with victimhood chic is the it sucks attention away from actual victims
* Change is as simple as choosing to give a fuck about something else. It really is that simple. It’s just not easy. 
* **As you reassess your values, you will be met with internal and external resistance along the way**

### Chapter 6: You’re Wrong About Everything (But So Am I)

* We used to believe lots of false truths - Ib
* I realized that each individual gets to decide what is “enough” and that love can be whatever we let it be
* **Growth is an endlessly iterative process. We go from wrong to slightly less wrong.**
* It’s easier to sit in a painful certainty 
* **Certainty is the enemy of growth. Nothing is for certain until it has already happened — and even then, it’s still debatable**
* Instead of striving for certainty, we should be in constant search of doubt
* All that we know for certain is what hurts in the moment and what doesn’t. And that’s not worth much. 
* The human mind is capable fo coming up with and believing in a bunch of bullshit that isn’t rel. And it turns out, we’re all really good at it. 
* Most of what we come to know and believe is the product of the innate inaccuracies and biases present in our brains. 
* Most our our beliefs are wrong — all beliefs are wrong, some are just less wrong than others
* Our memories are constantly deceiving us. It’s like the telephone game - Ib
* Our brain is always trying to make sense of our current situation based on what we already believe and have already experienced 
* **Often we run into life stations where past and present don’t cohere (Don’t rely on the past to explain the present - Ib)**
* Our beliefs are malleable and our memories are horribly unreliable
* If we’re wrong all the time, then isn’t self-skeptisism and the rigorous challenging of our own beliefs and assumptions the only logical route to progress?
* It’s freeing know that everyone including yourself is wrong about pretty much everything - Ib
* For individuals to feel justified in doing horrible things to other people, they must feel an unwavering certainty in their own righteousness, in their own beliefs and deservedness
* Evil people will never believe that they are evil, rather, they believe that everyone else is evil
* The problem here is that not only is certainty unattainable, but the pursuit of certainty often breeds more (and worse) insecurity
* The pursuit fo absolute certainty is futile - Ib
* **The more your embrace being uncertain and not knowing, the more comfortable you will feel in knowing what your don’t know** 
* Our own ignorance is greater than us all
* **Manson’s Law of Avoidance: The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it**
* We should all subscribe to a basic set of values that never change - Ib
* Arbitrary metrics why which you define yourself actually trap you
* Ask yourself this with regards to labels you place on yourself: “Maybe I’m not ___, but rather ___”
* There is little that is unique or special about your problems. That’s why letting go is so liberating.
* Measure yourself by more mundane identities: a student, a partner, a friend, a creator
* **The narrower and rarer the identity you choose for yourself, there everything will seem to threaten you. For that reason, define yourself in the simplest and most ordinary ways possible** 
* How to be less certain of yourself
    * Q1: What if I’m wrong?
    * Q2: What would it mean if I were wrong?
    * Q3: Would being wrong create a better or a worse problem than my current problem, for both myself and others?
* **We’re often fucking ourselves over in the pursuit of what we think is certain - Ib**
* If it feels like it’s you verses the world, chances are it’s really just you verses yourself

### Chapter 7: Failure Is The Way Forward

* You could make plenty of money and be miserable, just as you could be broke and be pretty happy
* To not pursue my own projects became the failure 
* Improvement at anything is based on thousands of tiny failures, and the magnitude of your success is based on how many times you’ve failed at something
* At some point, most of us reach a place where we’re afraid to fail
* **If we’re unwilling to fail, then we’re unwilling to succeed** 
* Whereas if I instead adopt the metric “Improve my social life”, I can live up to my value of “good relations with others” regardless of how other people respond to me. My self-worth is based on my own behaviors and happiness
* It’s growth that generates happiness, not a long list of arbitrary achievements
* **Our pain often makes us stronger, more resilient, more grounded** 
* Fear and anxiety and sadness are not necessarily always undesirable or unhelpful states of mind; rather, they are often representative of the necessary pain of psychological growth. And to deny that pain is to deny our own potential
* **Our most radical changes in perspective often happen at the tail end of our worst moments**
* If you continue to overindulge in various substances or activities, then you’ll never generate the requisite motivation to actually change
* Just shut up and do it
* VCR questions = questions that have really obvious answers but might involve a lot of pain (Paperwork to drop out of med school is easy to fill out, but actually dealing with the repercussions is hard)
* Learn how to sustain the pain you’ve chosen. When you choose a new value, you are choosing to introduce a new form of pain into your life. Relish it. Savor it. Welcome it with open arms. Then act despite it.
* Remember: You don’t know anything
* Life is about not knowing and then doing something anyway. All of life is like this. It never changes. 
* Embrace pain and failure - Ib
* **Do something principal: Don’t just sit there. Do something. The answers will follow.**
* Action —> Inspiration —> Motivation (so all you really need to do is take some sort of action, inspiration will follow)
* **Inspiration is a reward for taking action - Ib**
* If we follow the do something principal, failure feels unimportant. Any result is regarded as progress. 

### Chapter 8: The Importance of Saying No

* Absolute freedom by itself means nothing
* **The only way to achieve meaning and a sense of importance in one’s life if through a rejection of alternatives, a narrowing of freedom, a choice of commitment to one place, one belief, or one person**
* Travel is a fantastic self-development tool, because it extricates you from the values of your culture and shows you that another society can live with entirely different values and still function and not hate themselves
* To build trust you have to be honest. That means when things suck, you say so openly and without apology. 
* Be open to rejecting alternatives - Ib
* We need to reject something. Otherwise, we stand for nothing. 
* Avoiding rejection gives us short term pleasure by making us rudderless and directionless in the long term
* To value X, we must reject non-X
* The desire to avoid rejection at all costs, to avoid confrontation and conflict, the desire to attempt to accept everything equally and to make everything cohere and harmonize is a deep and subtle form of entitlement 
* It’s suspected by many scholars that Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet not to celebrate romance but rather to satirize it, to show how absolutely nutty it was
* The problem is that we’re finding out that romantic love is kind of like cocaine. Like frighteningly similar to cocaine. 
* The difference between a healthy and an unhealthy relationship comes down to two things: 1) how well each person in the relationship accepts responsibility and 2) the willingness of each person to both reject and be rejected by their partner
* People in a toxic relationship with poor or no boundaries will regularly avoid responsibility for their own problems and/or take responsibility for their partner’s problems
* By boundaries I mean the delineation between two people’s responsibilities for their own problems 
* **Do not take responsibility for other people’s problems - Ib**
* **People can’t solve your problems for you. And they shouldn’t try, because that won’t make you happy**
* Don’t blame other people for your problems, take responsibility. Do not be entitled - Ib
* Do not be the victim in the relationship. Do not be the saver. - Ib
* These are the yin and yang of any toxic relationship: the victim and the saver, the person who starts fires because it makes her feel important and the person who puts fires out because it makes him feel important
* Victims and savers both use each other to achieve emotional highs
* The last person I should ever have to censor myself around is the women I love
* When our highest priority is to always make ourselves feel good, or to always make our partner feel good then no body ends up feeling good 
* **Without conflict there can be no trust. Conflict exists to show us who is there for us unconditionally and who is just there for the benefits**
* If people cheat, it’s because something other than the relationship is more important to them 
* Unfortunately, building a track record for trust takes time — certainly a lot more time than it takes to break trust
* When trust is destroyed, it can be rebuilt only if the following two steps happen: 1) the trust-breaker admits the true values that caused the breach and owns up to them and 2) behavior over time
* But more is not always better. In fact, the opposite is true. We are actually often happier with less. 
* Now that I’m in my thirties, I can finally recognize that commitment, in its own way, offers a wealth of opportunity and experiences that would otherwise never available to me, no matter where I went or what I did
* **There is freedom and liberation in commitment** 
* Commitment gives you freedom because you’re no longer distracted by the unimportant and frivolous 

### Chapter 9: …And Then You Die

* **In the face of the inevitability of death, there is no reason to ever give in to one’s fear or embarrassment or shame, since it’s all just a bunch of nothing anyway** 
* In a bizarre, backwards way, death is the light by which the shadow of all of life’s meaning is measured. Without death, everything would feel inconsequential, all experience arbitrary, all metrics and values suddenly zero 
* (Taking about Becker’s book Denial of Death) 
* Humans are unique in that we’re the only animals that can conceptualize and think about ourselves abstractly
* We are all aware on some level that our physical self will eventually die, that this death is inevitable, and that its inevitability — on some unconscious level — scares the shit out of us. Therefore, in order to compensate for our fear of the inevitable loss of our physical self, we try  to construct a conceptual self that will live on forever
* Becker called such efforts our “immortality projects” — projects that allow our conceptual self to live on way past the point of our physical death
* All the meaning in our life is shaped by this innate desire to never truly die 
* If you haven’t figured it out yet, our immortality projects are our values
* People should question their conceptual self and become more comfortable with the reality of their own death
* Because once we become comfortable with the fact of our own death, we can then choose our values more freely 
* The Stoics of ancient Greece and Rome implored people to keep death in mind at all times, in order to appreciate life more and remain humble in the face of its adversities
* Mark Twain: “A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time"
* **Confronting the reality of our own mortality is important because it obliterates all the crappy, fragile, superficial values in life.** 
* Ask yourself: What’s your legacy?
* **The only way to be comfortable with death is to understand and see yourself as something bigger than yourself; to choose values that stretch beyond serving yourself, that are simple and immediate and controllable and tolerant of the chaotic world around you. This is the basic root of all happiness.** 
* You too are going to die, and that’s because you too were fortunate enough to have lived.
