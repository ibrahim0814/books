## The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles

### Book 1: Resistance - Defining the Enemy

* Resistance is invisible. It cannot be seen, touched, heard, or smelled. But it can be felt.
* **Resistance is internal.**
* Resistance is insidious. Resistance is always lying and full of shit.
* Resistance is impersonal.
* Resistance is universal.
* Resistance never sleeps.
* Resistance plays for keeps. It aims to kill.
* Resistance is fueled by fear.
* Resistance only opposes in one direction - from a lower sphere to a higher sphere.
* **Resistance is most powerful at the finish line**
* Resistance recruits allies. A peril that must also be guarded against: sabotage by others.
* **Procrastination is the most common manifestation of resistance.**
* Resistance and trouble: the working artist will not tolerate trouble in her life because she knows trouble prevents her from doing her work. The working artist banishes from her world all sources of trouble.
* Resistance and self-dramatization: creating soap opera in our lives is a symptom of resistance.
* Resistance and self-medication: instead of applying self-knowledge, self-discipline, delayed gratification, and hard work, we simply consume a product.
* Resistance and victimhood: casting yourself as a victim is the antithesis of doing your work. Don’t do it. If you’re doing it, stop. 
* **Resistance and unhappiness: we will never cure our restlessness by contributing our disposable income to the bottom line of Bullshit, Inc., but only by doing our work.**
* Resistance and fundamentalism: the truly free individual is free only to the extent of his own self-mastery. While those who will not govern themselves are condemned to find masters to govern over them.
* Resistance and criticism: individuals who are realized in their own lives almost never criticize others.
* Resistance and self-doubt: the counterfeit innovator is wildly self-confident. The real one is scared to death.
* **Resistance and fear: the more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it. So if you’re paralyzed with fear, it’s a good sign. It shows you what you have to do.**
* Resistance is directly proportional to love.
* Resistance and being a star: the professional concentrates on the work and allows rewards to come or not come, whatever they like.
* **Resistance and support: seeking support from friends and family is like having your people gathered around your deathbed.**
* Resistance and rationalization: rationalization is for cowards. It’s one thing to lie to ourselves. It’s another thing to believe it. 
* **Resistance can be beaten.**

### Book 3: Beyond Resistance - A Higher Realm

* As resistance works to keep us from becoming who we were born to be, equal and opposite powers are counter-poised agains it. These are our allies and angels.

* The magic of making a start: a whole stream of events issues from the decision - assistance which no man would have dreamed would come his way
* When we conceive an enterprise and commit to it in the face of our fears, something wonderful happens. 
* We we make a beginning, we get out of our own way

* We know that if we embrace our ideals we must prove worthy of them. And that scares the hell out of us. 
* In other words, none of us are born as passive generic blobs waiting for the world to stamp its imprint on us. Instead we show up possessing already a highly refined and individual soul. 
* We come into this world with a specific, personal destiny 
* The artist must operate territorially. He must do his work for its own sake. 
* To labor in the arts for any reason other than love is prostitution

* **A territory can only be claimed by work - what’s your territory?**
* For us to try to second guess our Muse the way a hack second guesses his audience is condescension to heaven. Its blasphemy and sacrilege. 
* Think about this as the last person on Earth - would you still pursue this? - Ib

* **To labor in this way is a form of meditation and a supreme species of spiritual devotion**

* Do it or don’t do it. Give us your best work.
